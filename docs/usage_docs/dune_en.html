<h2><a name="White_dune">"White_dune", what's that ?</a></h2>
<p>
White_dune is a graphical VRML97 editor, simple (NURBS) 3D modeller and 
animationtool in development.
It can read VRML97/X3DV files, display and let the user change the 
scenegraph, fields and routes.
This can be used to improve or make VRML97/X3DV 3D-worlds, animations and 
interactions. <br>
The modelling features of white_dune are not strong enough (yet), to use
it alone. It makes sense, to let it work together with a 3D modelling tool
with static VRML97 export (like for example wings3D or Art Of Illusion).<br>
In difference to most 3D modelling tools the lightning/coloring and the
interal structure of white_dune is based on the VRML97/X3D standards.
This leads to a better support of the possibilities of VRML97/X3DV, when
you create or postprocess 3D models with white_dune.<br>
Compared with the general purpose 3D modellers (which often  support
only the export of mesh (IndexedFaceSet) and interpolator nodes)
white_dune supports all VRML97 nodes and all of the nodes
of the X3D standard X3D Standard "X3D 3.3" (ISO/IEC 19775-1:2013),
event not all nodes are rendered.
<br>
white_dune is a open source program, this means that anyone 
may copy and change the program. The offical version is available at
<a href="https://wdune.ourproject.org">https://wdune.ourproject.org</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="crash">"White_dune" crashed, work lost ?</a></h3>
<p>
White_dune is work in development and it is not always as stable as it 
should be.
<br><br>
<b>If white_dune crashed, is your work lost ?</b>
<br><br>
<font color="#FF0000">No not automatically !</font>
<br><br> 
 "White_dune" will try to save the 
 VRML97 file short before crash. This is not always successful e.g. when the
 error which caused the crash destroyed the internal data structure (this
 occures seldom). 
 If the file is written sucessfully, white_dune will write under 
 Unix/Linux something like
<pre>
   Internal Crash !
   Try to save Files
   attempt to write file to /home/someone/.dune_crash_NUMBER_NUMBER.wrl
   write sucessful
</pre>
to standard error of the starting window and to system console 
(eg. to the window of the xconsole application).<br> 
The important line is the line "write successfull".<br>
Under M$Windows you get (possibly after clicking "ignore", if you are asked
about using a debugger) a similar Messagebox<br>
<img src=crash.jpg><br>
When you restart white_dune and use the file menu, you should see the filename
of this .dune_crash file.<br>
<img src=crashrestore.jpg><br>
Just click to it and save to another file.<br>
This Method can fail, if the error that led to crash
has damaged the internal data structure of the program.<br>
In this case it is worth to search in directory of VRML-files for
temporary files (".dune_*"), that are produced during the execution of 
<em>File-&gt;Preview</em> or <em>File-&gt;Textedit.</em><br>
These Files will be deleted at a normal program end, but not in case of a
program crash.<br>
When white_dune often crashes but all data can be restored successfully, 
it can be usefull to search this intermediate files and delete them
in order to recover diskspace.<br>
Beside files for preview and textedit, white_dune also stores the content of
edited scriptnodes in a temporary textfile for use by a texteditor.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="languages">Starting "White_dune" with foreign menues</a></h3>
<p>
White_dune can be started with menues in foreign languages.<br>
For example, to start white_dune with the german language, the 
commandlineoption "-german" must be used.<br>
Currently 4 commandlineoptions for languages are available:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    -english
  </li>
  <li>
    -german
  </li>
  <li>
    -italian
  </li>
  <li>
    -french
  </li>
</ul>
Beside that, there is a also a -portuguese option for portuguese,
but is works only for the 4kids menus.
<br>  
Cause it is not very usefull, always to type this in a commandline, 
there is a second way, to select the language. Under Linux/UNIX
this is done via the LANG environment variable. If the first 
2 characters of this environment variable is set to "de", german menus are 
used, if they are set to "it", italien menus are used ("fr" for french).<br>
If you want to work in a foreign language environment with $LANG set, but 
want to use the english menus for white_dune, you must use the -english
option.<br>
This can be done with a shellscript (Linux/UNIX/MacOSX) or batchfile 
(Micro$oft Windows).<br>
If you can not find a matching file (e.g. germandune for the german 
language), you can create one (e.g. for the german language) with the 
commandlines:
<ul>
 <li>
  For Linux/UNIX:<br>
  <pre>
     echo dune -german > germandune.sh
     chmod +x germandune.sh
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  For Micro$oft Windows:<br>
  <pre>
     echo drive:\pathto\white_dune_version.exe -german > germandune.bat
  </pre>
 </li>
</ul>
For MacOSX you can modify in the file
white_dune.app/Contents/MacOS/dunestarter the lines with the 
options for the program start:<br>
<pre>
   DUNEOPTIONS=" "
   export DUNEOPTIONS
</pre>
and add e.g. the -german option for the german language:<br>
<pre>
   DUNEOPTIONS="-german "
   export DUNEOPTIONS
</pre>
For other exotic UNIX desktops you will find similar options in the following
files
<ul>
 <li>
  SGI IRIX/4Dwm: desktop/irix*/duneoptions.m4<br>
  Read the file README_IRIX.desktop for more information
 </li>
 <li>
  IBM AIX/cde: /usr/local/bin/white_dune.dt
 </li>
 <li>
  Sun Solaris/cde: /opt/White_Dune/bin/white_dune.dt
 </li>
 <li>
  Redhat Linux/kde: /usr/share/applications/dune.desktop
 </li>
</ul>
In a similar way, it is possible to include other commandlineoptions
of white_dune. See <a href="dune.1.html" target="_blank"> the man page 
of white_dune</a> for other options. <br>
The most important options are:
<ul>
  <li>
  Options for 3D inputdevices<br>
  Supported inputdevices differ on different operationsystems. They include
  joystick, spaceball, dials or magnetic trackers.
  </li>
  <li>
  Options for stereoscopic view<br>
  This options (like "-stereo") are usefull for stereoscopic view with
  shutterglasses (or beamers).
  </li>
  <li>
  Options for white_dune variants:<br>
  Currently, there are 4 different variants of white_dune available.
  These variants can select either a completely different GUI or
  minor differences in the usable menus/toolbars.
  <ul>
    <li> 
     The -x3dv option<br>
     This option starts white_dune with support for a X3DV file from
     begin on. Without this option, a VRML97 file is created, that
     can be stored to a X3DV file (via the menupoint 
     <em>File -&gt; save as...</em>) later.
    </li>
    <li> 
     <a name="4kids">
      The -4kids option
     </a><br>
     This option starts white_dune with a total different, simplified
     menu. This menu is intended for total beginners. Is has been used
     in courses for children and juveniles.
    </li>
    <li> 
     The -4catt option<br>
     This option starts white_dune with a total different menu, intended
     for users of the 3D-soundsimulationsprogram Catt Acoustics 8.
     </li>
    <li> 
     The -cover option<br>
     This options supports some additional VRML nodes and extensions for the
     immersive VRML-Browser "cover/cover".
    </li>
    <li> 
     The -kambi option<br>
     This options supports some additional X3D nodes and extensions for the
     X3D based gameengine "kambi".
    </li>
  </ul> 
  </li>
  <li>
   The -tessellation option<br>
   The argument of the -tessellation option is a integer.
   It influences the number of vertices of a surface for nodes like
   Sphere, Cylinder, Cone and NURBS- or Superformula-nodes (with 
   u/vTessellation not zero) during rendering.<br>
   Therefore the -tessellation option is crucial for the usage of computers
   with missing 3D hardware-acceleration (and/or a slow processor).<br>
   With the -tessellation option is it possible to create and work with
   3D objects on under-performing computers. The objects will displayed
   coarse on the under-performing computer, but will be displayed complete
   on a powerfull computer. When the -tessellation option is missing,
   a default value of 32 will be used. The minimal possible value is 8.<br>
   The -tessellation Option do not help, when nodes like IndexedFaceSet,
   *Triangle*Set, Extrusion or ElevationGrid need to be displayed, cause
   the vertices of this nodes are defined from beginning.
   Therefore it should be avoided to convert from not nodes with not exactly
   defined vertices (e.g. Sphere or Cylinder) to this nodes on a 
   slow performing computer. 
  </li>
</ul>
The menus and dialogs of white_dune can be translated to foreign language
without programming skills.<br>
If you are interested to translate the white_dune menus and errormessages
into a new foreign language (no programming skills required), please read the 
<a href="../developer_docs/dune_developer.html#localisation"> 
step by step instructions about localisation</a> in the developer documentation.
</p>
<h3><a name="vrml">What is scenegraph, fieldvalues, routes etc. about ?</a></h3> 
<p>
White_dune (without -4kids or -4catt option)
is a lowlevel tool to make/change VRML97 or X3DV Files.
The user needs to knows the basic structure of VRML97/X3D.<br>
Of course white_dune can also be used to learn and explore the basics of 
VRML97/X3D. <br>
A good startpoint is of course the <a href="#4kids">
"-4kids" commandline argument, but then the features are limited to building
3D-Objects and Animation. The more interesting VRML/X3D features about
interaction and scripting are not available in the "-4kids" variant.
</p>
<p>
You can find some typical VRML/X3D examples (you can load into white_dune)
<a href=../typical_vrml_examples/index.html>here</a>, but take care about
the fact, this examples do not show modelling or animation features, they 
show mainly VRML97 examples about interaction and scripting. These are 
features, which can be not shown in white_dune directly (yet).<br>
The examples are a start base to build interactive 3D worlds with white_dune,
which are showed later with a "real" VRML/X3D browser.<br>
The route view and the scripting code is most interesting for a beginner.
</p>
<p> 
You can find detailed technical information about VRML97 
in the official ISO specification at
<a href=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1>
http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1
</a>.

For the use of white_dune, especially the node reference
<a href=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html>
http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html
</a>
is important.<br>
A good, simple tutorial about VRML97 for beginners you can find
(beside in a range of books) at
<a href=http://web3d.vapourtech.com/tutorials/vrml97/>
http://web3d.vapourtech.com/tutorials/vrml97/</a>.<br>
X3D is the sucessor of VRML97. Despite some minor technical differences
(which are handled automatically by white_dune) are alle commands of
the VRML97 standard still available in X3D.<br>
This is not the case for the "forgotten" VRML97 Amendment 1 Standard from
2002. Sone VRML97 Amendment 1 commands like e.g the CoordinateDeformer 
node do not exist anymore, but all still existing VRML97 Amendment 1 
commands are handled automatically by white_dune, when a VRML97 file is
stored as X3D(V) file.
</p>
<h2><a name="wonderland">X3D compiler und Open Wonderland Unterst&uml;tzung
    </a>
</h2> 
<p>
White_dune can export the data of the VRML97/X3DV scenengraph to the
programing languages C, C++ or java ("X3D-compiler").<br>
You will find the details in the <a href="dune_1.html#sect12">manpage of
white_dune</a>.<br>
There is a library for each of the programing languages C/C++ 
to render 3D objects and animation with OpenGL. You will find examples
in the directory 
<a href="../export_example_c/opengl_example">
docs/export_example_c/opengl_example</a> 
of the source archive. The similar example for the programing language C++
can be found in the directory 
<a href="../export_example_c++/opengl_example">
docs/export_example_c++/opengl_example</a>.
<br>
<!--
There is a library for the programing language java
to render 3D objects and animation with java OpenGL (jogl). You will find 
examples in the directory 
<a href="../export_example_java/jogl_example">

of the source archive.

<h3><a name="waskann">What "white_dune" can not do/can do</a></h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>White_dune is not a full featured VRML browser (yet) (and is still
  very wide away from a fulll featured X3D browser) and can not display 
  all Features of VRML/X3D</strong><br>
  It has features to create interactions and script programming, but you still 
  need <em>File -&gt; Preview</em>
  (or you have to save the file and open it in a VRML Browser) to test
  the results.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>White_dune is not a general purpose modelling tool</strong> (yet)<br>
  It has easy input features for primitive VRML97 shapes like Box, Sphere, 
  Cone and Cylinder and shapes like ElevationGrid and Extrusion, but not for
  other shapenodes like IndexedFaceSet (a shape made of multiple
  facets), IndexedLineSet and PointSet.<br>
  The most common shape in 3D modelling is the "mesh". Most 3D modelling 
  programs currently export "mesh" data to VRML97 as IndexedFaceSets.<br>
  </li>
  <li> 
  A also common object in 3D modelling is the "NURBS" object, which can
  be used in white_dune.
  Nodes like NurbsSurface, NurbsGroup or NurbsCurve are not part of 
  the traditional VRML97 standard from 1997, but they are part of the VRML97 
  Amendment 1 Standard from 2002. A VRML97 Amendment 1 incompatible NURBS 
  implementation is available in the X3D standard. 
  White_dune can convert automatically from VRML97 Amendment 1 NURBS to 
  X3D NURBS and vice versa. This depends from file extension at the save of 
  a file (.wrl for VRML97 Amendment 1, .x3d or .x3dv for X3D)<br>
  You can find a introduction to NURBS in a <a href="#nurbsbasics">
  later section</a>.
  Currently, VRML97 Amendment 1 is supported by VRML97 browsers like 
  bitmanagement/blaxxun cc3d/contact, but not implemented in no longer
  supported VRML browsers like cosmoplayer 2.1.<br>

  White_dune finally allows the conversion of all surface shapes to
  a IndexedFaceSet (at least all surfaces which can be rendered by
  white_dune itself, with the exception of Text).
  A IndexedFaceSet can be converted to a 
  IndexedLineSet, a IndexedLineSet can be converted to a PointSet.<br>
  But take care about the fact, that these convertions are working
  in only one way. A conversion back is not possible inside white_dune
  (except <a href="#convexhull"><em>Actions -&gt; Convex hull</em></a>, which 
  creates a IndexedFaceSet from the points of several objects).
  Thereforen a menupoint  <em>File -&gt; Export as ... -&gt; 
  PureVRML97</em> exists.<br>
  Animated Surfaces (simple Timer and Interpolator Animation)
  like NURBS or Superformula nodes will be changed to a Timer and 
  Interpolator Animation of a IndexedFaceSet on a export to 
  "PureVRML97", but via a conversion to a IndexedFaceSet.
  A problem is the accounting of values between two times for 
  NURBS/Superformula nodes. 
  The accounting is different from the CoordinateInterpolator node, 
  which is needed
  for IndexedFaceSet. Therefore a successfull conversion of such a
  animation need enough keyframes, more keyframes than a NURBS/Superformula
  based animation.

<h3><a name="fenster">The 5 windows of "white_dune"</a></h3> 
<p>
<img src=windows.png><br>
Beside some toolbars with icons and messages "white_dune" (without the
"-4kids" or "-4catt" startoptions) essentially contains 
5 windows. Beside the "3D Preview" window you can switch on/switch off
this windows via the menu "View". Switch this windows on and off to 
match your current work status.
<ul>
 <li>
  <b>Scene Tree</b><br>
  This window contains the scenegraph. This shows the structure
  of a VRML/X3D file, the information, how the VRML/X3D nodes are arranged.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>Field View</b><br>
  This window contains the fieldvalues, the numbers (or
  character strings) in a VRML/X3D file. Only the fields
  of the current selected node are shown.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>Route View</b><br>
  This windows contains the ROUTEs, the ways of information
  different VRML/X3D nodes can send messages between them.<br>
  According to the Settings in <em>options -&gt; RouteView Settings</em>
  there are either only the current ROUTEs are shown (like ROUTEs are
  stored in a VRML/X3D file) or the Routes and all existing nodes are shown.
  To show all nodes makes it easier to build new ROUTEs in small VRML/X3D files,
  but can be very confusing in very big VRML/X3D files.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>Channel View</b><br>
  This window is only valid for interpolator nodes.
  Interpolator nodes are most important for animations
  in VRML97 and X3D.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>3D Preview window</b><br>
  This Window can not be switched off and shows a
  preview of the graphical output of a VRML file.
  In difference to the other windows, the implementation
  of the VRML97 standard in this window is (still) incomplete.<br>
  Some VRML97 nodes like "MovieTexture", nodes are not shown at all. 
  The icons of not shown nodes are surrounded by a black frame.<br>
  The nodes from the not widely used VRML97 Amendment 1 Standard 
  (ISO/IEC 14772:2002) has the most failures, despite the fact that the
  nodes NurbsSurface, NurbsCurve and NurbsGroup from Amendment 1 are currently 
  responsible for the most powerfull 3D modelling features of white_dune.<br> 
  The support for X3D nodes is also not complete.<br>
  Not all fields are shown correctly, e.g.  the "Text" node under 
  Linux/UNIX/MacOSX should be seen as "better than nothing" (especially, 
  if the program is compiled without support from the GLUT library).
  The fieldvalues of the "FontStyle" node (which belongs to the "Text" node
  is also not correct (yet).<br>
  The field "convex" is (still) ignored too. When "convex" is set to "false",
  nonconvex polygons are displayed correctly.<br>
  <img src=convex_freewrl.png>
  <img src=convex_dune.png><br>
  Correct and false image of a IndexedFaceSet with nonconvex polygons
  with "convex false" in FreeWRL (links)
  and white_dune (rechts)<br>
  The problem with "convex false" exist also in Extrusion-based
  nodes. The are more rendering errors when using Extrusions.<br>
  The display of multiple transparent shapes is also errornous.<br>
  <a href="rendering_bugs/rendering_errors.html">Here</a> are detailed
  descriptions by Michalis Kamburelis (the author of the kambi VRML gameengine)
  of further errors in the 3D preview window.<br>
  <b> Of course, such a false image of a VRML object in the 3D Preview
  do not mean, there is a error in the VRML file</b>.<br>
  If in doubt, use <em>File-&gt;Preview</em> to start a VRML browser.

</ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="menue">Menu overview</a></h3> 
<p>
 The main menu of white_dune is seperated into the following submenus:
 <ul>
  <li>
   File<br>
   This submenu is intended for handling files, like loading, inserting
   and saving VRML/X3D files. It has can also be used to export to various 
   variants of VRML/X3D files and some other 3D file formats.<br>
   The File submenu also contain a way to edit the current file in
   text form without extra load/save dialogs.
  </li>
  <li>
   Edit<br>
   This submenu is used to copy, paste, delete or search objects.<br>
   It also contain a menupoint for the VRML/X3D "DEF" command. This command
   is used to assign a name to a VRML/X3D object. This can be used in
   a "ROUTE" statement to exchange messages between VRML/X3D objects.
   It can also be used for the "USE" command (also available in the "Edit"
   submenu), which creates a indistinguishable pointer to the object, 
   similar to a UNIX hard link.
  </li>
  <li>
   Selection<br>
   This submenu is used to control the selection.<br>
   The vertices of mesh objects, faces and lines of IndexedFaceSet and 
   the weights of HanimJoint can be selected.<br>
   "Range" refers to the vertices of IndexedFaceSet and Nurbs(Patch)Surface. 
   To use this, a first vertex has to be selected before
   <em>Selection -&gt; Range</em> is used. After this, a second vertex 
   has to be selected. All vertices become selected, that have a shorter
   distance to the first vertex than the distance between the first
   vertex and the second distance.<br>
   The menupoint "get old selection" restores the former selection, if
   possible.<br>
   The menupoint "Deselect" is used to reduce the current selection.<br>
   The menupoints "Show only selected Vertices", "Hide Vertices" and 
   "Unhide Vertices" can be used to temporary hide/unhide vertices from the 
   selection. This is usefull if the look a lot of vertices confuses the user.
  </li>
  <li>
   View<br>
   This submenu is intented for setting the used windows and toolbars.<br>
   Beside the possibility, to switch on or off single windows and toolbars
   there is also a menupoint <em> View -&gt; FullScreen</em>, which switchs
   off als toolbars beside the standard toolbar (e.g. with icons for
   open and save) and shows the 3D preview window as only window.
   This is very usefull to modell a 3D object or navigate inside the 3D world.
  </li>
  <li>
   Create<br>
   This submenu is intented for the creation of new VRML/X3D nodes.<br>
   The menu is orginised somewhat similar to the components of the X3D
   standard, but only VRML97 nodes are organised this way. 
   VRML97 Amendment 1 nodes, X3D nodes, X3D draft nodes and extension
   nodes for browsers like cover, kambi or x3dom are seperated in own submenus.
  </li>
  <li>
   Animation<br>
    This submenu is used to create and control animation.
  </li>
  <li>
   Actions<br>
   This submenu contains functions to change the VRML/X3D file.<br>
   A mayor part of this functions were designed cause they are not
   available in a lot of 3D modellers (or not supported by their
   VRML/X3D Export).
  </li>
  <li>
   Convert<br>
   This submenu is intended to support the conversion between 3D objects.<br>
   There are two classes of conversions:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Shape conversion:<br>
     The conversion of shapes means the loss of information in almost
     all cases. In a typical case, you start with a shape with only
     few parameters like a sphere with only one parameter (radius)
     or a scripted PROTO like SuperShape (with less than 20 parameters for
     a complex object). The next step may be the conversion to a 
     Nurbs(Patch)Surface. A typical Nurbs(Patch)Surface has much more 
     parameters then a primitive or scripted PROTO (if you don't count
     huge array of values as only one parameter). But unlike a 
     primitive etc., you can change small details of a Nurbs(Patch)Surface
     easily.<br>
     The next step could be the conversion to a IndexFaceSet (mesh).
     This also increases the possibilities to change details. 
     While a Nurbs(Patch)Surface can be changed via a few controlpoints,
     a IndexFaceSet has usually much more vertices as details, that can be 
     changed. But the conversion also looses control, cause the change
     of a controlpoint in a Nurbs(Patch)Surface can control a lot of
     vertices of a shape.<br>
     The next possible steps only loose information: the conversion to
     a IndexedLineSet only loose information about faces and the next
     possible step, the conversion to a PointSet only loose information 
     about the connections between the vertices.
    </li>
    <li>
     Interpolator creation:<br>
     This menupoints creates Position- and OrientationInterpolators from
     a NurbsCurve. Unlike the conversion of shapes, the new created 
     interpolator do not replace the NurbsCurve. The new created interpolator
     is not connected to other nodes. To use it for a animation, it
     need to be connected to a TimeSensor and a target node with the
     following Routes menu.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Routes<br>
   This submenu is used for VRML/X3D ROUTE commands.<br>
   The chapter about <a href="#route">Input/erase of ROUTEs</a>
   discribe this submenu.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mode<br>
   This submenu is used to set navigation and input modes.
  </li>
  <li>
   Options<br>
   This submenu is used to change settings.
  </li>
  <li>
   Help<br>
   This submenu shows helppages with a HTML webbrowser.
  </li>
  <li>
   ! (optional "teacher menu")<br>
   This submenu is only available, when the program was compiled with this
   option. It is used to mark right and wrong constructs.
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="navigation">Navigation</a></h3>
<p>
  To navigate in the 3D Preview Window, you have two differ between
  different walk modes.
  <ul>
   <li>
   Shift-Mouse 1: Zoom View
   </li>
   <li>
   Ctrl-Mouse 1: Rotate View
   </li>
   <li>
   Shift-Ctrl-Mouse 1: Move View
   </li>
  </ul>
  Additional you have from version 0.16 a SGI like navigation.
  Please note, that is it not seldom, that a similar configured windowmanager 
  interpret all mouse input, that uses the Alt key but itself....
  <ul>
   <li>
   Alt-Mouse1: Rotate View
   </li>
   <li>
   Alt-Mouse2: Move View
   </li>
   <li>
   Alt-Mouse1-Mouse2: Zoom View
   </li>
  </ul>
  When a 6D inputdevice is active and the Scene icon 
  <img src=sceneicon.jpg> is selected in the Scene Tree
  you can navigate depending on the transform icons <img src=schieb.png> 
  <img src=rot.png> <img src=6d.png> 
  <img src=rocket.png> <img src=hover.png>
  in the VRML file.<br>
  The Scene icon is selected, wenn you clicked into the void of the 3D preview
  window.<br>
  Additionally, there is each a Icon that forces navigation with the mouse
  <img src="mouse_navigation.png"> or the inputdevice
  <img src="inputdevice_navigation.png">.
</p>
<h3><a name="scenegraph">Changing the scenegraph</a></h3>
<p>
The most simple way to change the scenegraph is to add new node
by clicking to the matching VRML node icon.<br>
To identify a VRML node icon, move the mouse to it and wait. A descriptive
text will occure in the status bar at the bottom of the white_dune window.<br>
White_dune tries either to include the new node at the point of selection in
the scenegraph,<br> 
<img src=node_add_valid.jpg><br>
or to the root of the scenegraph ("Scene" icon).<br>
White_dune will gray out all node icons, that are impossible to add.<br>
<img src=node_add_invalid.jpg><br><br>
The following table shows the requirements for this nodes in the 
VRML97 standard:<br>
<ul>
<li>Appearance need Shape
<li>Material need Appearance
<li>ImageTexture need Appearance
<li>MovieTexture need Appearance (or Sound)
<li>PixelTexture need Appearance
<li>TextureTransform need Appearance
<li>Coordinate need IndexedFaceSet or IndexedLineSet or PointSet
<li>Color need IndexedFaceSet or IndexedLineSet or PointSetor or ElevationGrid
<li>Normal need IndexedFaceSet
<li>TextureCoordinate need IndexedFaceSet
<li>FontStyle need Text
<li>AudioClip need Sound
</ul>
For example a Appearence node need to be selected, to include a
ImageTexture node, or a Shape node need to be selected to include
a Appearence node.<br>
All of the matching node fields in the VRML97 are of type SFNode,
therefore only one node can be inserted. A icon is also grayed,
if there is already a matching node.<br>
For example you can not include two ImageTexture Nodes
to a Appearence node. Therefore the ImageTexture is also grayed,
if a Appearence node is selected, but a ImageTexture node is already there.
<br> 
According to the VRML97 Standard the shape nodes Box, Sphere, Cone,
Cylinder, IndexedFaceSet, IndexedLineSet, PointSet, ElevationGrid, 
Extrusion and Text need a Shape node. The needed structure
for the usage of this Shape.geometry nodes is clear.
Therefor the click on the icons and the usage of the 
<em> Create -&gt; Shape -&gt; </em> menuitems build a complete Shape-structure
(including default Appearance/Material nodes and a surrounding Transform node).
<br>
If the selection in case of a creation of such
a node is not a node a Shape node can be part of, the surrounding Transform
node is filled in a way, that the new node is shown directly in front of the
actual viewpoint.
<br>
For the new, but now deprecated nodes of the VRML97 Amendment 1 standard 
(CoordinateDeformer, NurbsSurface) there are additional rules.
<ul>
 <li>
  Coordinate need CoordinateDeformer 
 </li>
 <li>
  NurbsSurface need either Shape or NurbsGroup
 </li>
 <li>
  Contour2D need TrimmedSurface
 </li>
 <li>
  NurbsTexutureCoordinate need NurbsSurface
 </li>
 <li>
  TextureCoordinate need either VRML2 nodes or NurbsSurface
 </li>
</ul>
The extensions and extra nodes of the immersive Cover VRML97 browser 
also need additional rules.
<ul>
 <li>
  Wave need Shape
 </li>
 <li>
  VirtualSoundSource need VirtualAcoustics
 </li>
</ul>
The extensions and extra nodes of the kambi VRML game engine 
also need a additional rule.
<ul>
 <li>
 ImageTexture, PixelTexture and MovieTexture nodes need either their
 VRML97 nodes or KambiAppearance
 </li>
</ul>
White_dune itself also has a scripted PROTO extensions, which has 
also a additional rule.
<ul>
 <li>
  VrmlScene need VrmlCut
 </li>
</ul>
Cause there are much more X3D nodes than VRML97 nodes, the list of
needed nodes is very much longer:
<ul>
 <li>
  MultiTexture need Appearance
 </li>
 <li>
  ImageTexture need Appearance or MultiTexture
 </li>
 <li> 
  MovieTexture need Appearance or MultiTexture
 </li>
 <li>
  PixelTexture need Appearance or MultiTexture
 </li>  
 <li>
  MultiTextureTransform need Appearance 
 </li>
 <li>
  TextureTransform need Appearance or MultiTextureTransform
 </li>
 <li>
  MultiTextureCoordinate need IndexedFaceSet or NurbsPatchSurface
 </li>
 <li>
  FillProperties need Appearance
 </li>
 <li>
  LineProperties need Appearance
 </li>
 <li>
  NurbsTextureCoordinate need NurbsPatchSurface
 </li>
 <li>
  TextureCoordinate need either the need nodes for VRML97 nodes or 
  or IndexedTriangleFanSet or IndexedTriangleSet or IndexedTriangleStripSet  
  or TriangleFanSet or TriangleSet or TriangleStripSet
  or MultiTextureCoordinate
 </li>
 <li>
  Coordinate or CoordinateDouble need either the VRML97 nodes for 
  Coordinate or LineSet or IndexedTriangleFanSet or IndexedTriangleSet or 
  IndexedTriangleStripSet or TriangleFanSet or TriangleSet or 
  TriangleStripSet or NurbsPatchSurface or NurbsCurve or 
  NurbsPositionInterpolator or NurbsOrientationInterpolator or
  NurbsSurfaceInterpolator or NurbsTrimmedSurface
  or HAnimHumanoid or HAnimSegment
  or NurbsOrientationInterpolator
 </li>
 <li>
  Normal need either the needed VRML97 nodes or HAnimHumanoid or 
  IndexedTriangleSet or IndexedTriangleFanSet or IndexedTriangleStripSet
  or TriangleFanSet or TriangleSet or TriangleStripSet
 </li>
 <li>
  Color need either the needed VRML97 nodes
  or GeoElevationGrid or LineSet
  or IndexedTriangleFanSet or IndexedTriangleSet or 
  IndexedTriangleStripSet or TriangleFanSet or TriangleSet or 
  TriangleStripSet
 </li>
 <li>
  ColorRGBA need either the needed VRML97 nodes for Color
  or GeoElevationGrid
  or IndexedTriangleFanSet or IndexedTriangleSet or 
  IndexedTriangleStripSet or TriangleFanSet or TriangleSet or 
  TriangleStripSet
 </li>
 <li>
  NurbsCurve2D need Contour2D or NurbsSweptSurface
 </li>
 <li>
  ContourPolyline2D need Contour2D
 </li>
 <li>
  Contour2D need NurbsTrimmedSurface
 </li>
 <li>
  HAnimSegment need HAnimHumanoid or HAnimJoint
 </li>
 <li>
  HAnimJoint need HAnimHumanoid or HAnimJoint
 </li>
 <li>
  HAnimSite need HAnimHumanoid or HAnimJoint
 </li>
 <li>
  HAnimDisplacer need HAnimJoint or HAnimSegment
 </li>
</ul>
Additionally, there are rules for the X3D nodes of the 
Rigid Body Physics component, which is listed seperatly, cause this
rules alone are not sufficent for a sensefull use:
<ul>
 <li>
  RigidBody need BallJoint or DoubleAxisHingeJoint or SingleAxisHingeJoint
  or UniversalJoint or SliderJoint or MotorJoint or RigidBodyCollection or
  Contact
 </li>
 <li>
  CollideableOffset need RigidBody or CollidableOffset or CollisionCollection
  or CollisionSpace or Contact
 </li>
 <li>
  CollideableShape need RigidBody or CollidableOffset or CollisionCollection
  or CollisionSpace or Contact
 </li>
 <li>
  CollisionSpace need CollisionCollection or CollisionSpace
 </li>
 <li>
  CollisionCollection need CollisionSensor
 </li>
</ul>
This rules are not sufficent, cause only a structure make sense, where
CollideableShape and CollideableOffset nodes are in the root nodes
or the scenengraph and get USE-ed in several other nodes, which are
USE-ed again. To simplify the creation of this structure, there is
<a href="physics">a similar operation for scenegraph branchs</a>.
</p>
<p>
The commands <em>Edit -&gt; copy</em>, <em>Edit -&gt; paste</em> and
<em>Edit -&gt; delete</em> work similar to the same commands in many programs.
<br>
Of course only changes of the scenegraph are possible, which match
the rules above about "node A needs node B".
Depending on the selected node in the scenegraph (the target of a 
<em>Edit -&gt; paste</em> command) the menupoint <em>Edit -&gt; paste</em>
can be grayed out or not.<br>
In a unchanged scenegraph it can occured, that it is not possible to
insert a copied node at once, cause a node needed to inserted the copied
node is missing. The missing node must be created first, before the
copy action can be completed successfully.
</p>
<p>
A unusual command is the <em>Edit -&gt; copy branch to root</em> command. 
It copies all nodes along the path to the root of the current scenegraph branch
into the paste buffer.<br>
This can be very handy, if you need to double and split a scenegraph branch.
</p>
<p>
Another way to change the scenegraph is to drag parts of it with the
mouse.<br>
White_dune will show you with a icon of a stop sign, 
if the target node is not possible cause of the "missing node rules".
<br>
<img src=scenegraphchange_invalid.jpg><br>    
If the target node is possible, white_dune will show the normal mousepointer.<br>
<img src=scenegraphchange_valid.jpg><br>
The target is not possible, if there are multiple SF/MFNode fields of the
target node.<br>
<img src=scenegraph_multiple_target.png><br>
Nodes with multiple fields of type SF/MFNode (e.g. the collision node)
always display the field names in the scenetree (despite a opposite setting in 
the <em>Options -&gt; Preferences</em> dialog), so you can use the field names 
as targets in this case.<br>
<img src=scenegraph_multiple_fields.png>
</p>
<p>
Similar to the local copy/move in the explorer program of 
M$Windows2000 and similar filemanagers it is possible to change
the behaviour, if the keyboard is used when the mouse is still dragged:<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  Move: <br>
  no key pressed or Shift key pressed (icon do not change)
  <br><img src=scenegraphchange_move.jpg><br>
 </li>
 <li> Copy: 
  <br><img src=scenegraphchange_copy_ptr.jpg><br>  
  Crtl key pressed (icon add "+" picture)
  <br><img src=scenegraphchange_copy.jpg><br>  
 </li>
 <li>
  DEF/USE: 
  <br><img src=scenegraphchange_link_ptr.jpg><br>  
  Crtl key and Shift key pressed together (icon add "arrow" picture)
  <br><img src=scenegraphchange_link.jpg><br>  
  The USE construct is something like a undistinctable pointer,
  the reuse of a already existing node.<br>
  In a DEF/USE construct it is impossible to identify orginal and copy.
  <ul>
   <li>
    When you change the orginial, the copy changes too.
   </li>
   <li>
    When you change the copy, the original changes too.
   </li>
   <li>
    It has no consequences to the orginal, when you delete the copy.
   </li>
   <li>
    It has no consequences to the copy, when you delete the orginal.
   </li>
  </ul>
  This is similar to the hardlinks in a UNIX filesystem.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b><h4><a name="use">Using USE</a></h4></b><br>
 Beside the drag and drop method above, there is a additional way to use the 
 USE construct. The node to be USEd need a DEF name
 which can be applied with <em>Edit -&gt; DEF</em>. The usage of 
 <em>Edit -&gt; USE</em> (if possible) adds a new USE of the last DEFd node
 at the point of the selected node.<br>
 In white_dune (unlike when using a text editor on a VRML97 file), you can 
 legally delete the DEFd node. The first written formerly USEd node becomes 
 the new DEFd node.
 pointers.
 <br>
 Using USE is useful for keeping VRML files small (faster downloadable), 
 it increases maintainabilty and it can maybe used for faster rendering by a 
 smart VRML browser (e.g. by using glLists on OpenGL rendering).<br>
 Additional commands, that can create USE constructs are the <a href="#array">
 array tool</a> and some of the "create" scenegraph operations following. 
</p>
<p>
 <b><h4><a name="scenegraphoperations">Scenegraph Operations</a></b></h4><br>
 There is no way to move multiple nodes in the scenegraph (yet).
 As a workaround there are operations to rearrange the current scenegraph 
 branch (<em>Actions -&gt; Move Sibling -&gt; up/down/to first/last 
 position</em>)
 and operations which can be applied to all nodes
 in the scenegraph branch following the selection (including the
 selection itself). <br>
 <img src=scenegraphbranch_start.png><br>
 The are commands available via <em>Actions -&gt; Rest of scenegraph branch</em>:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>Move to </em><br>
   This command move the nodes into a grouping node (like Group, 
   Transfrom etc.)<br>
   <img src=scenegraphbranch_transform.png> <br>
   It is also possible, to bring nodes into a new VRML97 file and
   use this file via the Inline command, but only if there is no
   ROUTE has one of this nodes as target or a USE is used.
  <li>
   <em> Move 1 level up </em><br>
   This command moves the nodes into the same scenegraph branch as
   the parent of the selected node.<br>
   <img src=scenegraphbranch_up1.png> <br>
   <img src=scenegraphbranch_up2.png> 
  </li>
  <li>
   <em> Move to Transform selection</em><br>
   This command works only with a selected Transform node.
   It moves the nodes which follow the selected nodes into the 
   Transform node. In difference to the similar command to move
   into a new Transform node the position, orientation and scale of
   the nodes are important.<br> 
   In the selected node will be up to 7 (depending from the fields of
   the selected transform) new Transform nodes created. This up to
   7 Transform nodes equalize the position, orientation and scale
   of the moved nodes, so the global position, orientation and scale
   of the moved nodes do not change.<br>
   <img src=scenegraphchange_move_transform1.png><br>
   <br>
   <img src=scenegraphchange_move_transform2.png><br>
   This command is often used, to create multipart symetric objects.<br>
   In the first step, the most upper of the new inserted Transform
   node is selected and the menupoint <em> edit -&gt; copy </em> is used.
   <br>
   <img src=scenegraphchange_move_transform3.png><br>
   In the next step, the original selected Transform node is selected
   again<br>
   <img src=scenegraphchange_move_transform4.png><br>
   to duplicate the nodes with the menupoint <em> edit -&gt; paste </em>.
   <br>
   <img src=scenegraphchange_move_transform5.png><br>
   With a command like <em> actions -&gt; flip -&gt; x </em> the 
   duplicated nodes are mirrored.
   <img src=scenegraphchange_move_transform6.png><br>
   This procedure to create symetric objects only works, when the
   scaleOrientation field of the original selected Transform node
   do not make its contained object unsymetric.

   <em>Create</em><br>
   This command creates the new node 
   (ImageTexture, Material, Appearance, Normal etc.)
   at every possible place in the scenegraph branch.
   The created nodes are all belong to the Shape node.
   It has to be differed between nodes, which belong to the appearance
   field of Shape (ImageTexture, Material und Appearance) and nodes, 
   which belong to the geometry field of Shape (Normal, TextureCoordinate).
   For nodes, which to the appearance field, a new node is created at the
   first possibility in the scenegraph and for all following possibilities
   the node is reused via USE.<br>
   <img src=scenegraphbranch_create1.png><br>
   <img src=scenegraphbranch_create2.png><br> 
   This makes it possible to change the color, the material and the 
   texture of a whole scenegraph branch with little effort.
   Nodes which belong to the geometry field of shape will be generated
   according to the data of the Shape (e.g. a IndexedFaceSet).<br>
   To create any type of node at some places in the scenegraph, see the 
   <a href="#scenegraph_branch_fieldpipe"><em> special -&gt; field pipe </em> 
   </a> subcommand.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>Set</em><br>
   This command changes some fields (creaseAngle, transparency, etc.) in the
   scenegraph branch, which influence the view of a shape.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>Convert</em><br>
   This command converts some nodes into other nodes. This is very similar
   to the main <em>Convert</em> menupoint, but currently only conversion to
   IndexedFaceSet and TriangleSet is implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>Remove</em><br>
   This command remove some nodetypes
   (ImageTexture, Material, Appearance, Normal etc.) or general nodes 
   (depending on their name or DEF name) in the scenegraph branch.<br>
   Most of the nodetypes are corresponding to the nodes in the
   <em>Create</em> command, because the <em>Create</em> Command can only insert
   nodes, if the matching field is not blocked by a already existing node.<br>
   Somethings it is usefull, to remove the nodes in the first step and
   create them new in the next step.<br>
   For example, you have a lot of textured objects in a scenegraph branch and
   want to give them the same texture.
   In the first step, you remove the texture node everywhere and in the 
   next step you create a texture node everywhere. Cause the new texture
   node is always the USE "clone" of the first texture node, any change of
   this texture node will be result in the change of all created texture
   nodes<br>
   The removal of some of the nodes (e.g. Normal or TextureCoordinate) also
   has consequences to the remaining parent node, cause some of the fields
   of the parent node (e.g. normalIndex or texCoordIndex of the IndexedFaceSet
   node) should be removed too. In this cases, white_dune also removes
   this fields.<br>

     <a name="scenegraph_branch_fieldpipe"><em>Use field pipe</em><br></a>
     The <a href="#fieldpipe">concept of fieldpipe</a> 
     is discribed in a later capter. In this case is used for every
     node in the scenegraph branch with the name or DEF-name matching
     the nodefilter fields in the dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
     <a name="show_polygons">
      <em>Show polygons/primitives in status bar</em>
     </a>
     This command is a informational command and do not change anything in
     the Scenegraph. It can be used to find the part of the scenegraph,
     which contain the biggest number of polygons/primitives. This is
     very important for finding performance problems in realtime 3D data.<br>
     Primitives are nodes like Box, Cone, Cylinder and Sphere. For Primitives, 
     the number of polygons used in the VRML Browser depends from 
     the VRML Browser itself. For example, a VRML Browser can use 16 Polygons
     to draw the top surface of a Cylinder of a low quality view with
     sharp edges or can use 32 Polygons for better quality.<br>
     A Sphere usually use very much more polygons than a Box.<br>
     To find the part of the scenegraph, that contain the biggest number
     of polygons/primitives, you can use a binary search algorithm:<br>
     <ul>
      <nl> 
       Click to the scene icon at the root of the scenegraph and use
       <em>Actions -&gt; Rest of scenegraph branch -&gt; 
       Show polygons/primitives in status bar</em>.
       The result are the number of polygons/primitives in the whole VRML file.
      </nl>
      <nl>
       Select a node approximatly in the mid of the current level of the 
       scenegraph branch and use 
       <em>Actions -&gt; Rest of scenegraph branch -&gt; 
       Show polygons/primitives in status bar</em>.<br>
       If the number is greater than the half of the result of the last
       command, the majority of polygons/primitives is in the upper part
       of the current level of the scenegraph branch. Continue with the
       command at the approximatly mid of the upper part of the current 
       level of the scenegraph branch. <br>
       If the number is less than the half of the result of the last
       command, the majority of polygons/primitives is in the lower part
       of the current level of the scenegraph branch. Continue with the
       command at the approximatly mid of the lower part of the current 
       level of the scenegraph branch.<br>
       Continue with this scheme of using the mid of the remaining range of 
       the last command, till you find either a node or a range of nodes
       which contain the most polygons/primitives in your file.
      </nl>
      <nl>
       The node (or range of nodes) (e.g. if it is a Group or Transform node)
       can itself contain multiple other nodes. If you click to the plus
       sign in the Scene Tree of such a node you open a new level of the
       scenegraph branch. If you need to continue the search for the 
       part with the most polygons/primitives of the scenegraph branch,
       use <em>Actions -&gt; Rest of scenegraph branch -&gt; 
       Show polygons/primitives in status bar</em> and continue with the
       second step.
      </nl>

     <a name="build_physics">
      <em>Build RigidBodyCollection/CollisionSensor</em>
     </a><br>
     This command only is usefull for the X3D Rigid Body Physics component.
     In this case a complicated structure of nodes has to be build, full
     of DEF/USE constructs. This command collects CollideableShape and
     CollidableOffset nodes in the current scenegraph branch and builds
     the needed structure for Rigid Body Physics simulation. 
     Beside simulation parameters you only may need to add joint nodes, 
     and USE the RigidBody nodes in this joints.

     <em>Show polygons for Catt 8 in status bar</em><br>
     This command is similar to the <a href="#show_polygons">
     similar command to display the number of polygons/primitives</a>.
     The difference is the fact, that this command ist made for 
     the export into the Catt8 fileformat. The format for Catt8
     do not know primitives. Additionally Catt8 do not know doublesided
     surfaces, so the front and backfaces has to be exported 
     (and counted) twice.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 Unfortunatly some of these operations are (still) very slow.
</p>
<h3><a name="route">Input/erase of ROUTEs</a></h3>
<p>
In white_dune, there are two different settings, which drive the way to
insert a ROUTE.
<ul>
 <li>
  In <em> Options -&gt; RouteView Settings...</em> the checkbox for
  "Show all nodes in Routeview" is set:<br>
  All nodes in the scene are shown in the routeview.<br>
  This is usefull for working with small VRML files, but for VRML files
  with a lot of nodes, it can be horrible to find the right icon. 
 </li>
 <li>
  In <em> Options -&gt; RouteView Settings...</em> the checkbox for
  "Show all nodes in Routeview" is not set:<br>
  Only nodes with already existing routes are shown in the routeview.<br>
  To let a node without ROUTEs occure in the Routeview, you need to select 
  the node in the scene tree window and use the 
  <em>Route -&gt; show node on top</em> command.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
ROUTEs are made in white_dune by finding the right icon in the
RouteView Window (if you click to the icons, the matching
icon in the scene tree windows is selected) or useing
<em>Route -&gt; Move node to top</em> to add the node to the RouteView 
Window and click to the boxes of the matching events. The name of the matching
event is shown, and you can draw a line to the next icon/event.
<br>
<img src=routemake1.jpg><img src=routemake2.jpg> <br>
As required by the VRML standard, only events with the same
type (same color of boxes) can be connected.<br>
To erase ROUTEs, simply cut the line.<br>
<img src=routecut1.jpg><img src=routecut2.jpg><br>
As a sugestion for beginners, some event boxes are marked with a small
red point. The red point marks a important/often used event.<br>
Of course the importance/usage of events differ with the task of your
VRML world. All sensor nodes (the original source of most eventprocessing)
have event boxes with red points. 
</p> 
<p>
In complex VRML worlds with a lot of objects (for example the VRML export
from a 3D-Modelling program like Wings3D, Blender, AOI, Catia, 
3D Studio Max, Maya etc.) it can be difficult to find the wanted VRML nodes
in the RouteView window.
<br><img src=routeview_full.png><br>
There are operations to jump to the selected node (with 
<em> Routes -&gt; Unzoom/jump to selection </em>)
<br><img src=routeview_jump.png><br>
or zoom out of the Routeview (with <em> Routes -&gt; Zoom out</em>)
<br><img src=routeview_zoom.png><br>
but in such cases, the usage of the Inline VRML node
is recommended. It can be used to put static objects (for example parts
of the environment or parts of rigid shapes) in their own VRML files.
In result the complete VRML world can only consist of very few VRML nodes.
<br><img src=routeview_inline.png><br>
</p> 
<p>
<b>Commands with automatic generation of ROUTEs</b><br>
There are two commands to automatically generate new ROUTEs.
<ul> 
<li>
  <em> Action -&gt; animate </em><br>
  With this commands the ROUTEs for<br>
  TimeSensor -&gt; *Interpolator -&gt; selected node<br>
  will be generated. After using the command, a Dialog is opening, which
  ask for a new TimeSensor should be build or a already existing TimeSensor
  should be used.
  The dialog also asks what target event (field) in the selected node should
  be used. Depending on the Type of the target event a new Interpolator 
  is generated.
  <ul>
   <li>
    SFFloat: ScalarInterpolator
   </li>
   <li>
    SFVec3f: PositionInterpolator
   </li>
   <li>
    SFRotation: OrientationInterpolator
   </li>
   <li>
    SFColor: ColorInterpolator
   </li>
   <li>
    MFVec3f: CoordinateInterpolator (except the target node is
             a Normal node, then a NormalInterpolator is generated)
   </li>
   <li>
    In the X3D Standard there are additional Interpolators:
    <ul>
     <li>
      SFVec2f: PositionInterpolator2D
     </li>
     <li>
      MFVec2f: CoordinateInterpolator2D
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  When the value of the target event can be read, a new first key/keyValue
  pair with key=0.0 and keyValue=value_target_field will be set.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em> Action -&gt; add Interaction</em><br>
  In this case, the ROUTE<br>
  Sensor -&gt; selected node<br>
  will be generated.<br>
  Cause there are more than one possible target events in the selected
  node and different to the Interpolators, the assignment between
  target event type and sensor is ambigious. There are very much possibilities,
  a lot of them make seldom sense. Therefore there are two Listboxes:
  one Listbox you can use to select between recommended events and
  all events and a listbox, you can select already existing sensors.<br>
  In a window there are checkboxes will all sensor events/target events
  combinations for a new interaction, according to the selection of the 
  listboxes.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="fields">Changing fieldvalues</a></h3>
<p>
There is more than one way to change fieldvalues:<br>
<ul>
 <li> 
  <b><a name="keyboard">Keyboard input</a></b><br>
  By clicking with the mouse to the matching value and releasing the
  button. A text input window will open to input values from
  the keyboard.
 </li>
 <li>
   <b><a name="mouse">Mouse input</a></b><br>
   By pressing the left mousebutton on the matching value and not releasing the
   button, but moving the mousepointer to left or right. This will 
   decrease or increase the value. <br>
   <img src=fieldchange.jpg><br>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="MF">Changing "MF"-FieldValues</a></b><br>
  In the fieldview Window, a "+"-sign at the left side mark a "MF"-field 
  like MFFloat, MFInt32, MFVec3f, MFRotation, MFString etc.
  "MF"-Fields are arrays of data, you can count their content: first,
  second, third, etc.<br>
  To show/change the content of a "MF"-field, you need to click on the 
  "+"-character on the left side.<br>
  As in a VRML file a "MF"-field with only one data is shown similar
  a normal single data "SF"-field.<br>
  To add data to a "MF"-field, you need to click to the second column of 
  "+"-characters. New data is inserted at the next point of the array.<br>
  To insert at the first point, click to the right side of the fieldview
  before the first of a opened "MF"-field.<br>
  To delete from a "MF"-Field, click on the left side of the fieldview
  at the row with the data you want to delete and use the menuitem 
  <em>Edit -&gt; delete</em>.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="3DWindow">Changing FieldValues in the 3D Preview window</a></b><br>
   Changing in the 3D Preview window is also a chainging of the fieldvalues.
   Often transform nodes are changed.<br>
   During interactive work with the mouse in the 3D Preview window, the icons
   <img src=transform.jpg> select between a 
   <ul>
    <li> translation <img src=schieb.png> </li>
    <li> rotation <img src=rot.png> </li>
    <li> scale <img src=scale.jpg> </li>
    <li> uniform scale <img src=uniform_scale.png></li>
    <li> changing center <img src=center.jpg></li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <strong>Please note, you can not use this tools, when there
   is no transform node <img src=transform2.jpg> in the branch
   of the scenegraph</strong>.<br>
   Beside the Transformnode, other fieldvalues can be changed in
   the 3D Preview window. Most nodes have small white boxes ("handles"), 
   which belong to the "geometry" field of a shape node. 
   The moving boxes are e.g.
   connected with a edgepoint or a curve. Examples for such nodes with
   handles are
   Box, Cone, Cylinder, Sphere, ElevationGrid, Extrusion, PointLight,
   (Indexed)*Set, the X3DV/VRML97 Amendment 1 Nurb(Patch)Surface/NurbsCurve 
   Nodes or nodes, which are generated via scripting ("scripted PROTOs")
   from NURBS curves (z.B. SuperExtrusion, SuperRevolver)
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="6D">6D Input</a></b><br>
  Since version 0.19beta white_dune supports 6D inputdevices
  (6D is about the 6 degrees of freedom) under Unix/Linux.<br>
  is pressed, you can move a Transform node (and the containing objects)
  in all 6 degrees of freedom. The icon <img src=schieb.png> 
  limits the movement to translations, the icon <img src=rot.png> 
  limits to rotations.
  <br>
  The classic 
  6D inputdevice is the spaceball, a sort of joystick (which a sphere instead
  of a stick) which allows 
  only small excursions, but in all directions, including rotations.<br>
  <img src=spaceball.jpg><br>
  If you press the top of the spaceball for example, the object moves
  down. When you twist the spaceball, the object will follow this
  movement.<br>
  Similar devices are Magellan spacemouse and spacenavigator, they use
  a ergonomic plate instead a sphere.<br>
  The configuration of 6D inputdevices (still) works exclusively
  via commandlineparameters. Beside the type of the 6D inputdevices
  a scale of the inputvalues is needed for example:
<br>
<pre>
   white_dune -xinput spaceball -allxyz=20,200 -allrot=40,400
</pre>
<br>
  It is also possible to change the scale of the inputdevices when
  the program is running. Use 
  <em> Mode -&gt; Inputdevice -&gt; Increase input device </em>
  (icon <img src=faster.png>) or 
  <em> Mode -&gt; Inputdevice -&gt; Decrease input device </em>
  (icon <img src=slower.png>).
  <br>
  If you limit the movement to translations (<img src=schieb.png>), only 
  the "allxyz" scale
  is changed. If you limit to rotations <img src=rot.png>, 
  only the "allrot" scale is changed. 
<br>
  Beside the support via the Xinput protocol, Linux joystick and
  libsball are also supported. For details to the commandlineparameters
  see <a href=dune_1.html>the man page</a>. <br>
  Another 6D inputdevice are the dials (e.g. available under SGI IRIX).
  Per default, the inputaxes are awkward placed.<br>
  <img src=dials_default.jpg><br>
  Via Commandlineparameters
<br>
<pre>
     dune -xinput dialbox-1 -x=0 -y=2 -z=4 -xrot=1 -yrot=3 -zrot=5 -all=100,100,wheel
</pre>
<br>
  you can exchange the axes.<br>
  <img src=dials_normal.jpg><br>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="nxtdials">Mindstorms NXT dials Input:</a></b><br>
  A selfmade device very similar to the SGI dials can be build easily 
  with the Mindstorms NXT set.<br>
  <a href="nxtdials_en.wrl"><img src=nxtdials.png></a><br>
  Just attach a wheel/gear to each of 3 Mindstorm NXT motors, connect the 
  motors with the NXT brick, connect the NXT brick with your Computer 
  via USB and and you can use the result as a USB driven dials device. 
  <br>
  The access is done with libusb, which may need additional configuration, 
  <br>
  To use e.g. libusb functions unter Linux, a script like 
  <a href="../../tools/nxt_udev.sh">tools/nxt_udev.sh</a> is usefull.<br>
  The matching commandline to use the first ("0") brick connected to the 
  USB port is<br>
<pre>
     dune -nxtdials 0 -all=,,wheel
</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="6Dlocal">6D Local Mode Input:</a></b> 
  Do you know RC planes ?<br>
  When the 6Dlocal icon <img src=6dloc.png> is pressed, you can steer via
  the local axes of a transform node.<br>
  For example, if you move a spaceball into z-direction ("into the screen")
  the transform node (and the containing objects) move to the direction
  of it's local z axis, it follows the blue z-arrow.
  For example, if you move a spaceball into y-direction ("up")
  the transform node (and the containing objects) move to the direction
  of it's local y axis, it follows the green y-arrow.<br>
  <img src=6dlocal_right3.jpg><br>
  This is usefull, when object and transformnode are similar arranged.
  Normally the object is not in the direction of the arrows of it's
  transform node.<br>
  <img src=6dlocal_wrong.jpg><br>
  Therefore the transform node should be put into another and the
  transform node of the object should be rotated accordingly.<br>
  <img src=6dlocal_right1.jpg><br>
  <img src=6dlocal_right2.jpg><br>
  When you use this type of steering, you will see a effect, which
  is not surprising for users of RC planes:
  If the object is moving "toward you", a roll to the left of the 
  spaceball leads to a roll to the right of the object.<br>
  A similar transformnode is the rocket <img src=rocket.png> mode.
  In rocket mode, translations are only in the local z-direction allowed.
  This is useful, if you want to steer a object on a path while allowing
  all types of rotation.<br>
  A other similar transformmode is the hover <img src=hover.png> mode.
  In hover mode, rotations are allowed only around the local y-axis. 
  This is usefull, if you want to steer a object in-plane.<br>
  Other transformmodes, that work in a local mode (changes in direction of
  the local axes) are the scale <img src=scale.jpg> and
  changing center <img src=center.jpg> modes.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="joystick">Linux joystick Input:</a></b><br>
  Unfortunatly, "real" 6D inputdevices are not very widespread.
  So white_dune under Linux has support for joysticks.<br>
  There are a lot of different devices (including the spaceball), that
  can be used under Linux as joystick. <br>
  Joysticks are the natural inputdevices for the 
  <a href="#6Dlocal">6D local mode</a> or the "hover" mode.
  <br>
  You have to differ between 6D (e.g. gamepads with 2 thumbsticks and a 
  digital axescross, Labtec Spaceball, Magellan spacemouse), 
  4D (e.g. gamepads with 2 thumbsticks), 
  3D (z.B. joystick with a twisting stick (e.g. 
  Micro$oft Sidewinder Pro))
  and "normal" 2D joysticks.
  <ul>
  <li>
  6D joysticks (e.g. gamepads with 2 thumbsticks and a 
  digital axescross, Labtec Spaceball, Magellan spacemouse) are used like 
  all other 6D inputdevices.<br>
  For Gamepads gamepads with 2 thumbsticks and a 
  digital axescross it can be usefull to swap axes, when the digital
  axescross (which only allow movement with constant speed)
  is assigned to "important" directions (e.g. the forward/backward movement).
  </li>
  <li>
  4D joysticks (e.g. gamepads with 2 thumbsticks) do not allow 6D and
  6D Local mode. Beside translation <img src=schieb.png>, 
  rotation <img src=rot.png>, scaling <img src=scale.jpg> and
  changing of the center <img src=center.jpg> they support the 
  hover <img src=hover.png>
  mode and the rocket <img src=rocket.png> mode.<br>
  Depending from the mode, rotation and translation will be
  assigned to the appropriate axes.
  </li>
  <li>
  When using 3D joysticks (e.g. joystick with a twisting stick) things
  are more complicated. In the default configuration, a input via the
  3. axis (a twist of the stick) cause a movement assigned to the z-axis.<br>
  <img src=joystick_3D_move.jpg> <img src=joystick_3D_rot.jpg>
  </li>
  <li>
  When using a 2D joystick, there are not enough axes to make
  3D input data. Therefore you have to switch between the
  interpretation of the 2. axis as z-direction (near/far 
  <img src=near_far.png> mode) and as y-direction
  (up/down <img src=up_down.png> mode) via the icons.<br>
  On rotations the near/far <img src=near_far.png> mode is interpreted
  as rotation around the y-axis, the up/down <img src=up_down.png> 
  mode is interpreted as a rotation around the z-axis.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
  The rocket <img src=rocket.png> mode need 4 axes in a sense.
  To make it available with a 3D joystick, the rotationinformation of
  the near/far  
  <img src=near_far.png> Mode and up/down <img src=up_down.png>
  mode is used here.<br>
  Beim 2D Joystick steht der
  The rocket <img src=rocket.png> mode is not available for 2D joysticks.
  </li>
  </ul><br>
  Sometimes, a joystick axis looks not very useful
  (e.g. the extra controler of the Micro$oft Sidewinder Pro). <br>
  <img src=joystick_sidewinder.jpg><br>
  Therefore, the number of axes can be limited. To use e.g. the
  Micro$oft Sidewinder Pro as 3 axis joystick, you can use the 
  -axis option in the commandline.
<br>
<pre>
   white_dune -joystick /dev/input/js0 -axes=3
</pre>
<br>
  Gamepads are often overcrowded with less useful axes.
  For example the Logitech Wingman Cordless Gamepad report 9 axes when
  testing with the jstest programm. To use the 6 good axes
  (2 thumbsticks and the cross-hairs), you need to change the
  assignment of axes in the commandline.
<br>
<pre>
   white_dune -joystick /dev/input/js0 -y=4 -z=-1 -xrot=6 -yrot=3 -zrot=5
</pre>
<br>
  You have to interpret the option "-z=-1" in this way:
  the z-axes will be assigned to axis number 1 (this is the 2. axes, 
  counting begins with 0), but the inputdirection is reverted.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="joystick_windows">M$Windows joystick Input:</a></b><br>
  The support of a M$Windows joystick is very similar to a Linux
  joystick.<br>
  The special qualities of joystick drivers delivered with M$Windows
  should not make you wonder, if e.g. the 2. thumbstick of a gamepad
  do not deliver values or a joystick axis will be reported, but 
  can deliver only errors.<br>
  Beside this, the wisdom of the authors of the M$Windows joystick
  API leaded to the fact, a error of a axis must be interpreted
  as full turn (a similar problem leaded to the explosion of the 
  first Ariane 5 rocket....).<br>
  Therefore you should begin to test under M$Windows with only 2 axes.
  For the first M$Windows joystick (number 0) the commandline may look
  like:
<br>
<pre>
   white_dune.exe -joystick 0 -axes=2 -none=2 -allxyz=20,,,0.000001 -allrot=0.2,,,0.0000001
</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="joystick_macosx">MacOSX joystick Input:</a></b><br>
  A typical commandline for the joystick usage under MacOSX would be
<pre>
  dune -startX11aqua -SDLjoystick 0 -all=,,,0.000004 -y=-1 -xrot=2 -z=-3 -none=2 -allrot=0.2
</pre>
  but it is not common to use (but possible) the commandline under MacOSX.<br>
  Therefore white_dune is packaged in a MacOSX application named 
  white_dune.app.
  From the view of the commandline, white_dune.app is a usual directory,
  it is possible to enter it with a normal "cd" command.
  It is also possible to open the white_dune.app package with the "finder"
  program.
  There is a file "dunestarter", in the directory 
  white_dune.app/Contents/MacOS . It can be changed with a normal Texteditor.
  <br> 
  In this file there are the options for the programstart
<pre>
   DUNEOPTIONS=" "
   export DUNEOPTIONS
</pre>
  which can be extended with the options for the joystickusage, for example<br>
<pre>
   DUNEOPTIONS="-SDLjoystick 0 -all=,,,0.000004 -y=-1 -xrot=2 -z=-3 -none=2 -allrot=0.2"
   export DUNEOPTIONS

   <b><a name="channelview">Changing FieldValues in the ChannelView Window</a></b><br>
   The ChannelView Window is used to show or change 
   interpolator nodes.
   In a interpolator node, input values between 0 and 1 are assigned to
   a range of output values.<br>
   Interpolators are used in VRML for simple animations in the form
<br>
<pre>
   ROUTE TimeSensorDEFNAME.fraction_changed TO ??InterpolatorDEFNAME.set_fraction
   ROUTE ??InterpolatorDEFNAME.value_changed TO ??DEFNAME.set_??
</pre>
<br>
   The output "fraction_changed" of a TimeSensor node 
   (deliver values between 0 and 1) ist routed into the "set_fraction" 
   input event of a interpolator node. The interpolator node select a 
   matching intermediate value between the output values. The 
   result can be routed into a another VRML node, this leads to
   a animation without jerk.
  <br>
   In the following example:<br>
   <img src=interpolator.jpg><br>
   the output of a PositionInterpolators with the input values
   0, 0.3, 1 and the output values x=1 y=0 z=3, x=1 y=2 z=3, x=3 y=3 z=0
   is routed to the set_translation Input for a transform node.
   For example, the transform node (and the containing object) will 
   move in the timecycle from 0 to 0.3 from y=0 to y=2 (to the top).<br>
  <ul>
   <li>
   Easy usable are all SF-interpolators:
   <ul>
    <li>
     ColorInterpolator:<br>
     Interpolate between Colors.<br>
     Route targets for colors you will find at Shape-&gt;Appearance-&gt;Material    
    </li>
    <li>
     PositionInterpolator:<br>
     Interpolate between Positions.<br>
     Route target can be Transform.set_translation for example.
    </li>
    <li>
     OrientationInterpolator:<br>
     Interpolate between rotations.<br>
     Route target can be Transform.set_rotation for example.
    </li>
    <li>
     ScalarInterpolator:<br>
     Interpolate between single (floating point) numbers.<br> 
     Single numbers are possible EventIn's of multiple VRML Nodes.<br>
     There are multiple possibilities of usage.
    </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
   The following MF-interpolators are not easy to display in the ChannelView,
   there is a lot data that can simply flood the window. Therefore only
   changes of the MF-Values over the time is displayed. If there are not
   changes, the first value is always displayed <br>
   <img src=morphing_start.png><br>
   to allow to set additional 
   keys with the mouse <br>
   <img src=morphing_last.png><br>
   (e.g. to repeat the first timestep as last timestep)<br>.
   <img src=morphing_result.png><br>
   There is a upper
   limit in the number of displayed values. See "Limit keys in Channelview"
   in the <em>Options -&gt; Preferences</em> dialog. Set this limit 
   accordingly to the speed of your system.
    <ul>
     <li>
      CoordinateInterpolator:<br>
      Interpolates typically between points in a IndexFaceSet.<br>
      Animations, which use the CoordinateInterpolator are usually called 
      "morphing".
     </li>
     <li>
     NormalInterpolator:<br>
     Interpolate between the Normales of a IndexFaceSet.<br>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </li>
 </ul> 
 <br>
 <br>
  Some interpolator animation can be created in white_dune via
  changes in the 3D Preview window. 
  PositionInterpolator/Transform.set_translation
  and OrientationInterpolator/Transform.set_rotation based animations
  can also created with the recording of 6D inputdevices.<br><br>
  If you want to work with the tools <img src=recording.jpg>
  like a VCR recorder (record and playback animations) the following
  must be true:
  <ul>
  <li>
  The ROUTEs must have the form
  <br>
<pre>
   ROUTE TimeSensor.fraction_changed TO ??Interpolator.set_fraction
   ROUTE ??Interpolator.value_changed TO ??.set_??
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  In the Timesensor-Knoten the fieldvalue "loop" must be "TRUE".
  (the Animation will start again and again). 
  </li>
  <br><img src=timesensor.jpg><br>
  <li>
  The fieldvalue "starttime" of the Timesensor must be greater or equal
  to the fieldvalue "stoptime" of the Timesensor-Knoten.
  </li>
  </ul><br>
  Since ersion 0.27beta there is a menuitem 
  <em> Actions -&gt; Animate</em> in white_dune, which create this structure
  for the selected node. The menuitem is only available, 
  when the node has EventIns/ExposedFields of a type-matching intepolator.
  In the <em> Actions -&gt;Animate</em> dialog is asked
  <br><img src=animationdialog.jpg><br>
  if a new TimeSensor with what animation time should be created or
  a already existing TimeSensor should be used and what fields should
  be animated.
  <br>
  When only the recordbutton is pressed <img src="recording_one.jpg">, 
  during the creation of a animation, you have to change the timecursor 
  first and then input a value (via
  keyboard, mouse or 6D inputdevice).<br>
  <img src="animation_onetime.png">
  <br><br>
  <img src="animation_onetime2.png">
  <br><br>
  When the recordbutton is pressed together with the playbutton 
  <img src="recording.jpg">, the change of the values
  (via <a href="#mouse">mouseinput</a> or 6D inputdevice) is recorded
   continuesly. 
  <br>
  <img src="animation_recording.jpg">
  <br>
  The recording of the mouseinput require a calm hand.
  It is not uncommon to want to delete some of the recorded values.
  <br>
  <img src="delete_keys1.jpg">
  <br>
  You need to select a time range by pressing the left mousebutton and 
  dragging the mouse left/right in the channelview window and then use 
  either the 
  <em> Edit -&gt; delete </em> menuitem or the delete icon.
  <br>
  <img src="delete_keys2.jpg">
  <br>
  The matching values will be deleted. 
  <br>
  <img src="delete_keys3.jpg">
  <br>
  When deleting things, you have to take care about the last mouseclick
  you made.
  When you click to a object in the 3D preview window after the selection, 
  this object will be selected in the scene tree.
  The following <em>Edit -&gt; delete</em> command will then delete
  the object, not the range in the channelview.
  When you click to a element of a MF-field after the selection in the
  channelview, a following <em>Edit -&gt; delete</em> command will 
  then delete the element of the MF-Field.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="colorcircle">ColorCircle</a></b><br>
  There is a special inputwindow for colors, it takes place of the
  fieldView Window. To get it, a colorfield must be selected in the
  fieldView Window and the Colorcircle Icon must be pressed.<br>
  <img src=colorcircle1.png><br>
  With a mouseclick, you can select a color in the color circle and
  in the bar beside it, you can select a darker variant.<br>
  <img src=colorcircle2.png><br>
  Currently, when not using a true/directcolor display on Unix/Linux,
  the display of the color circle is slow (today, this occures only
  with very old graphiccards).<br>
  When the "OK" button is pressed, the normal fieldView window returns.

  <b><a name="scriptedit">Script Editor</a></b><br>
  There are two ways to start the scripteditor:<br>
  <img src=scriptedit_icon1.jpg><br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To create a new scriptnode:<br>
      Via the "Script" icon (menuitem <em>Create -&gt; Programming -&gt; Script</em>), 
    </li>
    <li>
      To change a existing scriptnode.<br>
      If a script node is selected, via the "Object Edit" icon 
      (menuitem <em>Actions -&gt; Object edit</em>), 
    </li>
  </ul>
  The scripteditor dialog<br>
  <img src=scripteditor.jpg><br>
  allows it, to add new fields/events to the scriptnode (add),
  to change them (change), to copy them (copy) or to delete them (delete).<br>
  Additionally it is possible to add special functions like
  Initialize, Shutdown and Eventsprocessed.<br>
  Press "OK" to finish the work on the script node.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="urledit">URL Editor</a></b><br>
  The "url"-field (it can contain the ECMAscript (javascript) code 
  of a scriptnode) can be changed in a texteditor.<br>
  Via the menuitem <em>options -&gt; Texteditor Settings</em>
  it is possible to select the texteditor.<br>
  When the "url"-field is empty, a scheme of a ECMAscripts will be created.<br>
  To start the textedit, select a Script Node and use the "URL Edit" icon
  (menuitem <em>Actions -&gt; Url edit</em>).<br>
  <img src=urledit.jpg><br>  
  The URL editor can also bei used to change the file content of a URL
  for local movie files (".mpeg") of MovieTexture nodes,
  for local sound files (".wav") of Audioclip nodes and
  for local picture files (".jpg"/".png") of ImageTexture nodes.<br>
  Often, a matching program to change files has already been selected
  during compiletime configuration (e.g. gimp for image files or audacity
  for soundfiles). If not, a dialog will ask first for a matching program.<br>
  The programs can be changed with
  <em>Options -&gt; Text/Object Editor settings...</em>.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a name="fieldpipe">Field pipe</a></b><br>
  One of the most powerfull ways to change field values is the field pipe.
  It allows you to change field values by any external program.<br>
  Usually there is no matching external program yet, so the field pipe is 
  mainly important for a user with programming capabilities.<br> 
  Beside the field pipe for single fields it is also possible to use
  the <a href="#scenegraph_branch_fieldpipe"> field pipe for scenegraph 
  branches </a>.<br> 
  If you select a SFField or MFField in the fieldview window and use
  <em>Actions -&gt; field pipe</em> one line with the fieldvalue is written to 
  a file in case of a SFField. In case of a MFField as much lines as the 
  number of SF-values in the MFField are written to the file.<br>
  For example, if you select the following TextureTransform.scale field 
<br>
  <img src=sffieldpipeselect.jpg><br>  
  (a SFVec2f field) the values<br>
  <pre>
      1 1
  </pre> 
  are written to the file.<br>
  For example, if you select the following Color.color field<br>
  <img src=mffieldpipeselect.jpg><br>  
  (a MFColor field) the values<br>
  <pre>
      0 0.5 0
      0.5 0 0
      0 0 0.5
      0.5 0.5 0
      0.5 0 0.5
      0 0.5 0.5
  </pre> 
  are written to the file.<br>
  The file ends with a newline character.<br>
  When using <em>Actions -&gt; field pipe</em>, a dialog is opened, that asks
  the user for a commandline. This commandline can be used to start a
  compiled program (e.g. written in programming languages like Ada, C, C++ 
  or Fortran) or a interpreter with a program in a interpreted language 
  (e.g. written in programming languages like awk, perl or python).<br>
  The given commandline is internally started with<br>
  <pre>
  commandline &lt; file &gt; outputfile
  </pre>
  which processes each line of the file as standard input with the given 
  commandline and writes the standard output result to the outputfile.<br>
  If the written outputfile has the same/matching structure as the 
  processed field/inputfile (e.g. for the SFVec2f example<br>
  <pre>
      2 1  
  </pre> 
  or for the MFColor example<br>
  <pre>
      1 0.5 0
      0.5 1 0
      0 0 0.5
      0.5 0.5 0
      0.5 0 0.5
      0 0.5 0.5
  </pre>
  where it is important, that Color values are floating point values 
  in the range between 0 and 1. The content of the outputfile is 
  used as new fieldvalue and the intermediate input/output files are 
  removed.<br>
  The most simple example of a field pipe is simply using the "echo" system
  command.<br>
  The commandline<br>
  <pre>
       echo some th ing
  </pre> 
  simply writes back the arguments<br>
  <pre>
       some th ing
  </pre> 
  In a very simple example, this can be used to change the values "1 1" to
  "2 1" by useing<br>
  <pre>
       echo 2 1
  </pre> 
  as the commandline in the field pipe dialog.<br>
  For the following more complicated (but more realistic) example, the 
  awk programming language is 
  used, a interpreted language rather similar to the C language. Awk is
  very handy for this task, cause it splits a input line automatically into 
  values and accepts complete programs given on the command line.<br>
  If you use the following commandline<br> 
  <pre>
       awk '{print $1 + 0.1 , $2 + 0.2 , $3 + 0.35}'
  </pre> 
  as field pipe for the following MFColor field<br>
  <pre>
      0 0.5 0
      0.5 0 0
      0 0 0.5
      0.5 0.5 0
      0.5 0 0.5
      0 0.5 0.5
  </pre> 
  the result would be<br>
  <pre>
      0.1 0.7 0.35
      0.6 0.2 0.35
      0.1 0.2 0.85
      0.6 0.7 0.35
      0.6 0.2 0.85
      0.1 0.7 0.85
  </pre>
  E.g. if this MFColor field would be used as the colors of the corners
  of a IndexedFaceSet Box, the command would make all the corner colors a bit
  more bright, a bit more green and more blue.<br>
  The same example in the C language would require to write a program like
  the following:<br>
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   while(!feof(stdin)) {
      float c1, c2, c3;
      scanf("%f %f %f", &c1, &c2, &c3);
      printf("%g %g %g\n", c1 + 0.1, c2 + 0.2, c3 + 0.35); 
   }
   return 0;
}
</pre>
  If this file is named main.c you would need to compile the file (e.g. with
  a command like<br>
  <pre>
      cc -o /tmp/a.exe main.c
  </pre> 
  on the commandline) and you would have to use something like
<br>
  <pre>
   /tmp/a.exe
  </pre> 
  in the field pipe dialog.<br>  
  One of the most simplest usage of the UNIX echo command in a filepipe is the
  remove of nodes by simply using
  <pre>
      echo
  </pre> 
  for the matching parent node/parent field.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="simplescript">Simplified scriptbuilding</a></h3>
<p>
Before you can use the scripteditor dialog, you need plan what 
are the datatypes and eventIn/eventOut informations of the nodes 
you want to connect. To do this, you need to read the
node description of the 
<a href=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html>
VRML standard</a> (e.g. you can use the menuitem 
<em>Help -&gt; <i>name of currently selected Node</i></em> or use 
a advanced book).<br>
For fast experimenting, you may find it more convenient to use a
simplified scriptbuilding method.<br>
Create a new "empty" scriptnode with the "Script" icon (or the 
menuitem <em>Create -&gt; Programming -&gt; Script</em>).<br>
Following the 
<a href="http://dune.sourceforge.net/philosophy.html" target="new">
"get out of the way!" philosophy</a> of the orginal dune project,
simply press "OK" on the scripteditor dialog (see above).<br>
Now you can use the RouteView window for further work. 
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild1.jpg><br><br>
Scriptnodes have a special "connect anything" eventOut. 
If you click and drag this with the mouse, a white route will be drawn.
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild2.jpg><br><br>
Keep the mousebutton pressed while routing and you see (like "normal" routing), 
you can connect this route to eventIns of other nodes,
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild3.jpg><br><br>
but (unlike "normal" routing) the color of the route (marking the datatype) 
can change with the probed eventIn.
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild4.jpg><br><br>
When you release the mousebutton, the route will be established.
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild5.jpg><br><br>
In a similar way, you can use the special "connect anything" eventIn
of the scriptnode
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild6.jpg><br><br>
and connect it to a eventOut of a other node.
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild7.jpg><br><br>
Now you need to edit the "url" field of the script node. 
Beside using <a href="#urledit">urledit</a> you can also
select the script node in the SceneTree window, the "url" field in
the FieldView. 
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild8.jpg><br><br>
and  press the "Object Edit" icon (or use the menuitem 
<em>Actions -&gt; Object edit</em>). 
<br><br><img src=simple_scriptbuild9.jpg><br><br>
Now "white_dune" will try to start a external editor - UNIX die-hards use
"xterm -e vi", this is the default under Linux/UNIX ("xedit" for MacOSX,
"edit" for M$Windows)
if $WINEDITOR was not set at first run. You can change the editor with the 
<em>Options -&gt; Texteditor Settings ...</em> menuitem. <br>
In the editor window, you will see a schema of the needed 
javascript code.<br>
<img src=simple_scriptbuild10.jpg><br><br>
<br>
Use the editor to complete the javascript code and save/quit the
editor - in case of the vi editor use the keystrokes :wq 
<br> Use <em>Options -&gt; ECMAscript settings</em> to control, if you want
extended comments in the schema. 
<br> A lot of comments are written per per default. This is usefull for
beginners, they only have to select from the possible commands for the
used datatypes. But unfortunatly, this makes larger scripts difficult 
to read.<br>
User with experience tend to uncheck anything in the
<em>Options -&gt; ECMAscript settings</em> window, so only the hardwired
comments about the used datatypes remain.

<h3><a name="nurbs">NURBS Modelling</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> <h4><a name="nurbsbasics">NURBS basics</a></h4>
<p>
When used in computergraphics, the term NURBS means a
complicated mathematical formula,
which can be used to store random surfaces and curves in a very compact way.<br>
Especially for a networkstandard like VRML the suppport of NURBS is a 
great advantage, cause it avoids the transfer of the data of all 
vertices of a surface mesh. Instead only a relative small amount
of numbers have to be transfered. The numbers can be used to account
the data of the vertices. <br>
This is a advantage, cause accounting power raised very much more than
network speed (for example: the computer which sended 1969 the
first Character ("L" from "LOGIN") over the Internetprotocol
was a Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer with 12KB memory,
a clock of 1.1 Mhz (but needed much clockticks for one assemblercommand)
and the weight of a half ton. This computer used a networkconnection
with 50000 baud. This is approximatly the same as the computerpower of
a simple calculator and the networkconnection of a modern telephon modem.<br>
Therefore NURBS support was added not only to the X3D standard.
It was also added to the VRML97 standard in 2002 (VRML97 amendment 1).
</p>
<p>
According to "The NURBS book" (by Pigel/Tiller) NURBS reads as 
"Noone Understands nonuniform Rational Basis Splines".<br>
You do not need to understand completely this mathematics to work with a NURBS
modeller. But it can be useful for the usage of a programm like
white_dune (which has access to all numbers of NURBS surfaces and 
curves) to understand the basics.
</p>
<p>
When you produce a NURBS curve (with
<em> Create-&gt;VRML97 Amendment 1 Node-&gt;NurbsCurve </em>/OK) and move the little 
white boxes and open all numbers in the fieldView
<br><br><img src=nurbscurve.jpg><br><br>
you can see, that a NURBS curve use essentially 4 types of data.
<ul>
<li>
controlPoints:<br>
This is the main part of the positions of the points marked with white boxes 
(the other part of the positions is the weight).<br>
When you move a box, a part of the curve moves similarly.
<br><br><img src=controlpoint.jpg><br><br>
controlPoints are the most important elements in white_dune, to 
influence NURBS.
</li>
<li>
weight:<br>
These values is responsible for the influence of each controlpoint to the 
whole
curve. The word "weight" remembers to the time before the computerage
as curves were made with thin pieces of wood and weights.
When the controllpoint stays at place and the weight is increased,
<br><br><img src=weight.jpg><br><br>
the curve will be pulled nearer to the controlpoint.<br>
Despite the controlpoint is a the same place, its value has been
changed. The reason is related to the fact there are two equivalent 
mathematical
formulas to store NURBS (homogeneous and inhomogeneous form).
</li>
<li>
knot: <br>
Knot values are responsible (among other things) if a controlpoint
hits a line and if there is edge. To force this, the values
has to be repeated "degree" "(order - 1)" times.
<br><br><img src=knot.jpg><br><br>
</li>
<li>
order: (also (degree+1))<br>
This number is responsible how far reaches the influence of a
controlpoint.
<br><br><img src=order.jpg><br><br>
</li>
</ul>
The remaining value "tessellation" has no mathematical, but a
practical background. It is responsible for the number of points/edges
the curve is shown.
<br><br><img src=tess3.jpg><br><br>
The change of this value allows a easy fitting to the graphicspower
of a computer.
<br><br><img src=tess11.jpg><br><br>
Per default (value "0"), white_dune (which should also run on weak computers)
uses too small values of "tessellation".<br>
A example shows a Nurbs(Patch)Surface, that was converted from a sphere.
Some controlpoints were pulled out.
<br><br><img src=tess0.jpg><br><br>
Only with a high value of "tessellation" you see the "real" shape of the object.

White_dune let you create a Nurbs(Patch)Surface (e.g. with 
<em> Create -&gt; VRML97 Amendment 1 -&gt; NurbsSurface -&gt; plain/OK</em>). 
You can change this surface with the mouse,simply drag the white boxes 
around.<br>
<br><br><img src=nurbsurface1.jpg><br><br>
This changes the controlpoints of the Nurbs(Patch)Surface.
<br><br><img src=nurbsurface2.jpg><br><br>
In this type of operation white_dune is most useful to form landscape with 
dunes
<br><br><img src=dunes.jpg><br><br>
but is not very useful for most other tasks.
</p>
<p>
A lot of objects to model require some symetric modelling, 
one half of the object should look similar to the other side of the object.
In white_dune, this can be done with <em>Actions -&gt; X symetric modelling</em>.
When this is active, any movement of the controlpoints of one side 
<br><br><img src=symetric1.jpg><br><br>
will be also applied to the other side,
<br><br><img src=symetric2.jpg><br><br>
and it is rather easy to build a rather complicated symetric 
Nurbs(Patch)Surface.
<br><br><img src=mantasurface.jpg><br><br>
The X direction for symetric modelling has been choosen cause of the
<a href="#6Dlocal">local input modes</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to limit the movement of the controlpoints to a line or
a plain.<br>
With only one of the settings <em>Mode -&gt; only x</em>, 
<em>Mode -&gt; only y</em>
or <em>Mode -&gt; only z</em> (or their icons with one arrow in x (red), y (green)
or z (blue) direction) the movement of the points is limited into this
direction. The direction is not the direction in the global space, it is
the direction of the matching geometry. Only the x, the y or the z value
of the moving controlpoint is changed.<br>
If for example only the <em>Modus -&gt; only y</em> (the second of the 
arrow icons) ist used
<br><br><img src=yonly.jpg><br><br>
the movement of the controlpoints is limited to the y-direction.
This is the direction the green arrow of the last Transform node which
match the geometry is pointing to.
<br><br><img src=yonly1.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=yonly2.jpg><br><br>
When two of the settings <em>Mode -&gt; only x</em>, <em>Mode -&gt; only y</em>
or <em>Mode -&gt; only z</em> (its icons with only one arrow to x (red), y (green)
or z (blue) is used, the points can be moved in the matching plain.<br>
If for example only the <em>Mode -&gt; only x</em> and  <em>Mode -&gt; only z</em> 
or the first and the third of the arrow icons is used
<br><br><img src=xzonly.jpg><br><br>
the movement of the the controlpoints is limited to the xz-plain.<br>
When all or no icon is used,
<br><br><img src=no_only.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=xyzonly.jpg><br><br>
there is no limit, the movement of the point with the mouse can change
the x, y or z values.
</p>
<p>
The decision if to move the symetric part of a Nurbs(Patch)Surface is driven
by the decision if the values of the symetric controlpoints/weights is 
nearly the same.
They are nearly the same, if the distance of the absolute values is
smaller then a value "Epsilon". The value of "Epsilon" can be set
in the <em>Options -&gt; Preferences</em> dialog.<br>
When symetric modelling has been choosen, multiple points at nearly the
same place snap together and move together. 
This can be used to close open Nurbs(Patch)Surfaces,
but multiple controlpoints at one place of a NurbsSurface result in a edge/peak.
<br><br><img src=closedpeak.jpg><br><br>

It is also possible, to move more than one controlpoints together.<br>
This is done with a click of the middle mousebotton to a white box,
the white box becomes green.<br>
When additional boxes have been clicked with the middle mousebutton,
they also change their color into green.<br>
<br><br><img src=middle_mouse.jpg><img src=middle_mouse2.jpg><br><br>
When one of the green boxes is moved via the left mousebotton, the other
boxes will follow.<br>
When <em>actions -&gt; X symetric modelling</em> is activated, the matching
controlpoints one the other side will be moved accordingly.
<br><br><img src=multihandle.jpg><br><br>
When <em>actions -&gt; X symetric modelling</em> is activated, it is not
possible to select two symetric boxes (on the exact matching position on the
other side).
<br><br><img src=xsymetric_mouse.jpg><br><br>
The second middle mouseclick would have no effect.
<br><br><img src=xsymetric_mouse2.jpg><br><br>
It is also possible to select multiple small boxes in one time.
You have to use the right mouse button to drag a invisible box.
To do so, you have to position the mouspointer e.g. to the left upper
corner of the invisible box,<br>  
<br><br><img src=multiselect1.png><br><br>
push the right mouse button and hold down the botton, put the mouse pointer 
into the right lower of the invisible box and release the right mouse button.
After the mouse button was released, all white small boxes in the invisible 
box become green, that means selekted.<br>
<br><br><img src=multiselect2.png><br><br>
If <em>actions -&gt; x symetric modelling</em> is active, only one side of the
each selected white boxes become selected.<br>
A new created nurbssurface exists (according to the
VRML standards) per default only one sided (which is important, when the
surface is not closed): field "solid" is TRUE.
<br><br><img src=mantasurface1side.jpg><br><br>
In most cases this is not very useful. 
Change the field "solid" in the FieldView to FALSE, to 
make the surface double sided.
<br><br><img src=mantasurface2side.jpg><br><br>
Often even a two sided surface is not useful to form a shape with a volume.
In this case it is recommended to create a NurbsGroup node
<br><br><img src=nurbsgroup1.jpg><br><br>
Move the Shape with the Nurbs(Patch)Surface into the NurbsGroup node.
<br><br><img src=nurbsgroup2.jpg><br><br>
Then copy the Shape with the Nurbs(Patch)Surface once again into the 
NurbsGroup. 
To do this, drag the Shape icon into the NurbsGroup icon and then 
hold down the control-key ("Ctrl") while the mousebutton is still pressed.
<br><br><img src=nurbsgroup3.jpg><br><br>
Cause the field "solid" is still FALSE in this example, a common problem of 
realtime 3D can be demonstrated when the color of one shape is changed:
<br><br><img src=zfight1.jpg><br><br>
<b>Too thin walls</b> (also called "z-fighting"). <br>
When you move one controlpoint of one Nurbs(Patch)Surface a bit upward, 
to give the shape
more volume, your rendering hardware and software is not capable to
decide, which of the close two surfaces with which color face the viewer.
<br><br><img src=zfight2.jpg><br><br>
This effect is not predictable, it can change with the viewing angle,
the used software (e.g. VRML browser or used graphics driver) and even 
with the used graphics hardware (graphics card).
<br>
To avoid the problem, you have to switch back the both "solid" field to 
TRUE and use the "ccw" field ("Counter Clock Wise") to differ between 
the upper side and lower side of a one sided surface.
<br><br><img src=zfightok.jpg><br><br>
Now you can now move the nonborder controlpoints of the lower 
Nurbs(Patch)Surface to give the shape more volume.
<br><br><a href="../../logo/manta.wrl"><img src=nurbsgroup4.jpg></a><br><br>
The NurbsGroup node is in the VRML standard responsible to draw the borders 
of the contained 
Nurbs(Patch)Surfaces connected, when the controlpoints of the border of the
Nurbs(Patch)Surfaces are identical.<br>
In white_dune, a NurbsGroup also allow X symetric modelling. Changes of
a controlpoint are distributed to all Nurbs(Patch)Surfaces that are directly
(or via a shape node) contained in a NurbsGroup.<br>
This allows to move the controlpoints on the border of one Nurbs(Patch)Surface
and keep the whole thing closed, course the matching controlpoints of
the neighbour Nurbs(Patch)Surface nodes are moved accordingly.
<br><br><a href="../../logo/manta2.wrl"><img src=nurbsgroup5.jpg></a><br><br>
At the end, you should take care that the NurbsGroup is contained in a 
Transform node, otherwise you can not move/rotation/scale etc. 
the object.
<br><br><img src=nurbsgroup6.jpg><br><br>
</p> 
</li>
<li> <h4><a name="nurbsconversion">NURBS conversion</a></h4>
<p>
When building closed Nurbs(Patch)Surfaces, it can be usefull to start with 
a already close shape. White_dune do not allow to convert a mesh 
(a IndexedFaceSet node) to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface (yet), but allows 
you to convert the VRML primitives (box, cone, cylinder and sphere) 
to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface. It also allows
you to convert a NurbsCurve to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface (by revolve).<br> 
Since version 0.27beta it also allows to convert a NurbsCurve to a
Superextrusion PROTO (see below) and it allows to convert a SuperEllipsoid
PROTO or SuperShape PROTO (see below) to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface by approximation.
</li>
<ul>
<li>
box<br>
To convert a box to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface, first select a box in the 
Scenegraph
<br><br><img src=box.jpg><br><br>
and use the menuitem <em>Convert -&gt; Convert to Nurbs(Patch)Surface</em>.
<br><br><img src=box2nurbsdialog.jpg><br><br>
If you switch off the "6 Plains" checkbox, you get a single Nurbs(Patch)Surface.
<br><br><img src=oneboxnurbs.jpg><br><br>
If the "6 Plains" checkbox is pressed, you get 6 plains in a NurbsGroup 
forming a box.
<br><br><img src=sixboxnurbs.jpg><br><br>
</li>
<li>
cone, cylinder and sphere<br>
Convertion of this primitives is similar to the convertion of a box,
but the objects are build internally with a revolving line (better NurbsCurve).
For example, in the result of a cylinder conversion 
<br><br><img src=cylinder.jpg><br><br>
you see that there are controlpoints that reach the surface. This
has been done by the repeat of values in the knotvectors. As a consequence,
a edge will be created at the matching places when the controlpoints are
moved.
<br><br><img src=cylinderedge.jpg><br><br>
</li>
<li>
Creating a Nurbs(Patch)Surface via a revolving NurbsCurve<br>
First a NurbsCurve node has to be selected in the scenegraph
<br><br><img src=nurbscurve_scenegraph.jpg><br><br>
When creating a NurbsCurve (e.g. via 
<em> Create -&gt; VRML97 Amendment 1 -&gt; NurbsCurve </em>) 
you should take into account, if you want to
continue with X symetric modelling or not.<br>
The NurbsCurve creation dialog 
<br><br><img src=nurbscurvedialog.jpg><br><br>
offers you three options: Curve along x, along y, along z axis.
Only if you revolve a curve along the y or z axis, x-symetric modelling 
is possible. So you may prefer to create a NurbsCurve only along the
y or z axis. <br>
<a name="rotating_nurbscurve"></a>
<br><br><img src=nurbscurverotationy.jpg><br><br>
Drag now the curve points to form the side view of the revolved shape.
<br><br><img src=nurbscurverotation2.jpg><br><br>
Now use <em> Convert -&gt; Convert to Nurbs(Patch)Surface</em> to continue.
<br><br><img src=nurbsrotationdialog.jpg><br><br>
To make X symetric modelling possible, you should keep the checkbox 
"Flatten Curve before rotation" pressed. It moves all points into one
plain, but keeps the distance from the origin.
<br><br><img src=nurbsrotationsurface.jpg><br><br>
As with a converted Sphere, Cylinder and Cone a edge may be created, 
when the controlpoints are moved.
<br><br><img src=nurbsrotationsurface2.jpg><br><br>
Rather similar to the NurbsCurve rotation is the <a href="#superrevolver">
scripted SuperRevolver PROTO</a>. The SuperRevolver node generates a 
NURBS surface based shape on each change of a ("flattend") 2D curve, but as a 
scripted PROTO, it is only a indirect part of the Standard.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<li> <h4><a name="elevatedegree">Degree elevate</a></h4>
<p>
During modelling with NURBS nodes you may wish to insert new
controlpoints in one direction.
<br><br><img src=elevate_before.jpg><br><br>
With the menuitem 
<em> Actions -&gt NURBS operations -&gt; Elevate (U/V) Degree up </em> 
is this possible, without changing the shape. 
<br><br><img src=elevate_after.jpg><br><br>
With the new controlpoints you can make a new notch.
<br><br><img src=elevate_target.jpg><br><br>
</p>
</li>
<h4><a name="nurbsrebuild">NURBS rebuild</a></h4>
<li>
Unfortunatly the Degree elevate is not sufficent, to build
complex NURBS shapes. It can happen, that you need a lot of new
controlpoints.<br> 
In a simple example a sphere (<em>Create -&gt; Shape
-&gt; Sphere</em>) is converted to a NURBS object (<em> Convert -&gt;
Convert to Nurbs(Patch)Surface</em> OK). 
<br><br><img src=sonne1.png><br><br>
45 new controlpoints are  created (some of them cover itself).<br>
This is too few, to model a oldfashioned sun and draw single
sunbeams.<br>
With the select of Nurbs(Patch)Surface 
and <em>Actions -&gt; NURBS operations -&gt; Rebuild controlpoints</em>
a lot of controlpoint can be created
<br><br><img src=sonne2.png><br><br>
and
<br><br><img src=sonne3.png><br><br>
drawn out.

<p>
When a controlpoint is pulled out of a NURBS surface, a situation occures
that the next contolpoint will change the structure of the object (e.g.
sphere) bascially.<br>
To avoid this, new controlpoints have to be inserted at the right place.<br>
The result is a NURBS extrusion. <br>
If a sphere with 6 u and 8 v control points is used and
4 u/v control points are selected,<br> 
<img src=nurbsextrude1.png><br>
2 points each u/v can be added/pulled out with
<em>Actions -&gt; NURBS operations -&gt; Extrude NurbsSurface</em>.<br>
2 points cause this is the preset in the following dialog:<br>

<img src=nurbsextrude3.png><br>
</p>
</li>
<li> <h4><a name="nurbsindexedfaceset">Building IndexedFaceSet</a></h4>
<p>
NURBS surfaces are often seen as rounded faces. But beside multiple
controlpoints and knotvector values, the setting of 
u/vTesselation values
can easily be used to build a object with edges (IndexedFaceSet).<br>

<br><br><img src=spherefaceset1.jpg><br><br>
For example, if you convert a sphere node with 
<em>Convert -&gt; Convert to Nurbs(Patch)Surface</em> 
<br><br><img src=spherefaceset2.jpg><br><br>
and set u/vTesselation to low values, you get a only a few faces.
<br><br><img src=spherefaceset3.jpg><br><br>
With <em>Convert -&gt; Convert nurbs to IndexedFaceSet</em> you can can
convert the result to a IndexedFaceSet node.
<br><br><img src=spherefaceset4.jpg><br><br>
To get rid of the normalssetting, which smooth the colors of the
faces, you need to delete the Normal node from the IndexedFaceSet.
<br><br><img src=spherefaceset5.jpg><br><br>
</p>
<p>
The following table shows what basic-like shapes can be converted from
primitives, when setting u/vTesselation in Nurbs(Patch)Surface 
<table>
<tr><td>Shape</td><td>Converted</td><td>uTesselation</td><td>vTesselation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tetraeder</td><td>Cone</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>

<p>
When you create a Nurbs(Patch)Surface plain (<em>Convert -&gt; 
VRML97 Amendment 1 -&gt; NurbsSurface -&gt; Plain (Nurbs)</em>)
with degree 1 
<br><br><img src=degree1faceset1.jpg><br><br>
and set the uTesselation to uDimension-1 and set vTesselation to vDimension-1,
the visible edges and the position of the handles (of the nurbsSurface)
are identical, exactly as in a IndexedFaceSet.
<br><br><img src=degree1faceset2.jpg><br><br>
With <em>Convert -&gt; Convert nurbs to IndexedFaceSet</em> you can can
convert the result to a IndexedFaceSet node.
<br><br><img src=degree1faceset3.jpg><br><br>
To get rid of the normalssetting, which smooth the colors of the
faces, you need to delete the normals node from the IndexedFaceSet.
<br><br><img src=degree1faceset4.jpg><br><br>
Unfortunatly, 
the convertion from a IndexedFaceSet back to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface is
not implement yet...
</p>
</li>
<h4><a name="nurbsanimation">Animation with the help of NURBS</a></h4>
<li>
<p>
It is possible to create animation data from a NurbsCurve.
To do so, you need a NURBS curve and animatable Objekt.<br>
<br><br><img src=nurbsanimation1.png><br><br>
If you select the NURBS curve,<br>
<br><br><img src=nurbsanimation2.png><br><br>
you can use <em>convert -> copy to 
PositionInterpolator</em> and <em>convert -> copy to 
OrientationInterpolator XZ/XY/YZ plane</em> to create a 
PositionInterpolator/OrientationInterpolator pair. In doing so
you have to select a plane, which is orthographic to the rotation axis.<br>
<br><br><img src=nurbsanimation3.png><br><br>
To create an true VRML animation, a TimeSensor node has to be added.
(<em>Create -> Sensor -> TimeSensor</em>).<br> 
After that, you have to use <em>Routes -> Show node on top</em> 
to connect the TimeSensor node, the Interpolators and the Transform node
this way<br>
<br><br><img src=nurbsanimation4.png><br><br>
with routes.<br>
When TimeSensor.loop is TRUE gestellt, the animation follows the NurbsCurve.
</p>
<p>
The Menupoint <em>Animation -> create Curve Animation</em> accommodate all
this steps together. A special EXTERNPROTO will be created, that includes
all information of a NURBS curve (the VRML97:2002 variant). This EXTERNPROTO 
uses javascript nodes to be displayed in a standard VRML browser as
the same animation. For non standard VRML browsers like X3DOM, which do not
support Script nodes, the CurveAnimation can be converted to a
PositionInterpolator and a OrientationInterpolator. This is done
automatically when you export to C/C++ sourcecode.<br>
The CurveAnimation node contains additionally the axis of rotation and
the field "hover", which discribe the rotation is either in direction of
the roation axis or turns additionally in the direction of the NURBS curve
(for a not flat NURBS curve in the direction of the rise of the NurbsCurve).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="nurbstrimmed">NURBS Trimming</a></h3>
<p>
In version 0.99pl1050 the NurbsTrimmedSurface Knoten node is really useable.
<br>
The defaults and the behaviour of NurbsCurve2D is designed for it.<br>
When want to try NURBS Trimming, <a href="door.x3dv">
this example</a> is available.<br>
The abbreviation "ccw" in the NurbsCurve2D dialog means that the created
closed curve is oriented Counter Clock Wise.
If the curve is clock wise, the content of the curve is cut off, overwise
the rest is cut off.
By the way: this curve musst be always closed, otherwise a crash in the
grphic library "libGLU" can occure 8-(.
When the curve is changed via handles in white_dune, the curve keeps closed.
</p>
<h3><a name="super">Superformula Modelling</a></h3>

<h4><a name="superformula">Superformula basics</a></h4>
<p>
 White_dune has support for 3D-modelling based
 on the so called "superformula"
 <br>
<pre>
        pow(pow(fabs(cos(m * angle / 4.0) / a), n2) + 
            pow(fabs(sin(m * angle / 4.0) / b), n3), -1.0 / n1)
</pre>
<br>
This formula has been found by a biologist a few years ago and can be used to 
form n-symetric shapes similar to shapes in nature like flowers, leafs, insect
bodies, shells or starfishs.
<br><br><img src=supershapes.jpg><br><br>
See this <a href="supershapes.wrl" target="_blank">range of shapes</a>, 
which are all done with the SuperShape PROTO.
<br><br>
Superformula based shapes are not part of VRML97 by itself and are 
implemented by a PROTO (self defined VRML97 node) with scripting 
("scripted PROTO").<br>
Superformula based shapes can be converted either to a 
Extrusion node or to a IndexedFaceSet node. IndexedFaceSet based scripted 
shapes can also be approximated to a Nurbs(Patch)Surface node as a starting 
point for further NURBS-modelling.
 <ul>
  <li>
   <h4><a name="superextrusion">SuperExtrusion</a></h4>
   
   The SuperExtrusion PROTO uses the superformula to account a 2D polygon
   in the X-Z-plane and form a shape by repeating this polygon in the
   Y direction along a curve. The curve is similar to a NurbsCurve and can 
   be changed by moving the controlpoints. This shape can be converted to
   a Extrusion and some of its parameter work similar to a Extrusion.
   Unlike the Extrusion node, the scale parameters are not applied to
   each spine point, they are smeared over the whole spine. 
   <br><br><img src=superextrusion.png>
  </li>
  <li>
   <h4><a name="supershape">SuperShape</a></h4>
   
   The SuperShape PROTO uses the superformula to account a 2D polygon
   in the X-Z-plane and form a shape using the superformula also in
   the Y-Z-plane similar to spherical coordinates. 
   <br><br><img src=supershape.png><br><br>
   This shape can be converted to a IndexedFaceSet.
  </li>
  <li>
   <h4><a name="superellipsoid">SuperEllipsoid</a></h4>
   
   White_dune also has a PROTO for the superellipsoid, a special case of a 
   supershape. It can be used to form a sphere, 
   <br><br><img src=superellipsoid_sphere.jpg><br><br>
   a box, a cylinder, 
   <br><br><img src=superellipsoid_cylinder.jpg><br><br>
   a octaeder and rounded forms of this shapes 
   <br><br><img src=superellipsoid_box_smooth.jpg><br><br>
   <br><br><img src=superellipsoid_cylinder_smooth.jpg><br><br>
   with only 2 parameters.
   Like the SuperShape PROTO the SuperEllpsoid PROTO has a field "border",
   e.g. to form a half sphere.
   <br><br><img src=superellipsoid_sphere_half.jpg><br><br>
   This shape can be converted to a IndexedFaceSet.  
  <li>
   <h4><a name="superrevolver">SuperRevolver</a></h4>
    The SuperRevolver PROTO works similar to the 
    <a href="#rotating_nurbscurve">rotation of a NurbsCurve</a>,
    but uses the superformula instead of a rotation and a two dimensional
    curve instead of a three dimensional curve.
    <br>
    The default values of the super formula (a=1, b=1, m=0,
    n1=1, n2=1, n3=1) form a circle on a 2D plain.
    This form can be also seen, if a SuperRevolver is seen from above.
    <br>
    Unlike the rotation of a NurbsCurve, the usage of a SuperRevolver
    do not require the conversion between different types of objects. 
    Instead the 2D nurbscurve can be changed interactivly at any time 
    and the SuperRevolver shape is changed accordingly.
    <br><br><img src="superrevolver.png"><br><br>
    There is also a field "pieceOfCake", which allows it to cut "cake pieces"
    out of the shape.
    <br><br><img src="superrevolver_pieceofcake.png"><br><br>
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="subdivide">Subdivide Modelling</a></h3>
<p>
Subdivide Modelling is available via the 
<em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; subdivide</em>
command or pressing "s" if a mesh based node (e.g. IndexedFaceSet, Box
or NurbsSurface) is selected. Subdivide uses the Catmull-Clark Algorithm
to make objects smoother. <br>
You can start with a selected box:
<br><br><img src="box.png"><br><br>
Use <em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; subdivide</em> or press "s"
<br><br><img src="box2.png"><br><br>
Use <em>selection -&gt; faces</em> and drag the clicked face out with
the left mouse button still pressed.
<br><br><img src="box3.png"><br><br>
To get it smoother again, use <em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; subdivide</em> or press
"s"
<br><br><img src="box4.png"><br><br>
To hide the faces, you can set creaseAngle of the IndexedFaceSet.
<br><br><img src="box5.png"><br><br>
Be aware that ist no unsmooth command in white_dune, except the tessellation
fields in Nurbs(Patch)Surface or superformula based nodes.
<br><br><img src="box6.png"><br><br>
So it is usefull to often use <em>edit -&gt; undo</em> to test and modify the
subdivided object.
<br>
Unfortunatly Subdive do not work with all faces, it works only with closed
objects. Therefore is Subdivide gray when a SuperExtrusion node is selekted.
<br>
In the same way as faces, lines can be selected with <em>selection -&gt; lines

</p>
<h3><a name="extrusion">IndexedFaceSet Extrusion</a></h3>
<p>
When the selected X3D-Command is a IndexedFaceSet (or has been converted
to a IndexedFaceSet) a special way of extrusion is available.
One or more faces of a IndexedFaceSet can be pulled out or pushed in.
<br>
You have to select <em>Selection -&gt; Faces</em> and Coordinate of
IndexedFaceSet.
With the middle mousebutton you can select one or more faces.
<br><br><img src="extrusion2.png"><br><br>
When the X Symetric icon <img src="symetric_pressed.png"> is selected,
faces on the other side are also selected.
<br><br><img src="extrusion3.png"><br><br>
In the same way faces can be pushed into a body.
<br><br><img src="extrusion4.png"><br><br>
This makes sense with
<a href="#subdivide">Subdivide Modelling</a>.
<em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; (IndexedFace)Set -&gt; Extrude Face </em>

<br><br><img src="extrusion6.png"><br><br>
<em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; Subdivide</em>

The same with matching IndexedFaceSet.creaseAngle 
<br><br><img src="extrusion8.png"><br><br>
</p>
<h3><a name="coordinate">Changing coordinate based nodes</a></h3>
<p>
Since version 0.29beta also Coordinate based nodes 
(like IndexedFaceSet ("Mesh"), IndexedLineSet or PointSet)
can be changed interactivly in the 3D preview window in the same way
as changing the controlpoints of a NURBS shape.<br>
For nodes with very much vertices, this is (still) only usefull to 
change small details.<br>
There is also a way to scale or rotate vertices (take care of the 
"center"-position), this is done by selecting the scale or rotation icon.
</p>
<h3><a name="flip">Flip/swap and set center actions</a></h3>
<p>
There are a few handy modelling actions in the <em>Action</em> menu:
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>Flip (x/y/z)</em><br>
  The Flip command can be used for whole scenegraph branches. It changes
  all values of the Transform and Shape (sub-)nodes from x to -x, y to -y
  or z to -z. This is usefull to mirror a branch of objects after doubling
  the branch. When used on difficult objects like Cone or IndexedFaceSets,
  flip tries keep things constistent. A Cone can not be flipped in the
  y-direction, therefore the cone of a y-flip command is converted to a 
  Nurbs(Patch)Surface first. For a Surface node like the IndexedFaceSet, flip 
  takes care about the normal and ccw fields. A Coordinate node in the 
  IndexedFaceSet also support the <em>Flip</em> command, but you have
  to take care about the normal and ccw field by yourself.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>Swap (xy/yz/xz)</em><br>
  The Swap command can also be used for whole scenegraph branches. 
  E.g. the xy command exchanges the x and y values in all matching nodes.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>move to (x/y/z)</em><br>
  This command only works for NURBS and Coordinate nodes. It 
  sets all points in the x, y or z direction to the asked value.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>Set Center to (mid min/max x/y/z)</em><br>
  This command requires the combination<br>
  Transform -&gt; Shape -&gt; geometrynode<br>
  where the geometrynode (e.g. Box, Sphere, IndexedFaceSet etc.) is selected.
  The command set the center (rotation point) of the Transform node to the 
  mid or the borders of the bounding box of the geometry. This is usefull
  when working with modelling tools, which export VRML objects with the
  rotation point wide away from the object.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4><a name="insets">Cut "windows" in a Box</a>
<small>(new in Version 1.876)</small></h4>
<p>
In white_dune there is the possibility, to cut out a small surface out
of a surface ("inset").<br>
With a box converted to IndexedFaceSet, there is also the possibility to cut out
multiple "windows".<br>
To do this, a face of the box need to be selected.<br>
<img src="insets1.png"><br>
Use <em> (IndexedFace)Set -&gt; inset(s)</em><br>
<img src="insets2.png"><br>
There is a dialog, you can input x and y (there are some limits).<br>
In the next image, all faces of this sode are selected<br>
<img src="insets3.png"><br>
In the next image, all "windows" are selected.<br>
<img src="insets4.png"><br>
Use <em> (IndexedFace)Set -&gt; split away selected faces </em>,
select, the 2. Shape<br> 
<img src="insets5.png"><br>
and use <em> edit -&gt; delete </em>
to cut out the windows.<br>
<img src="insets6.png"><br>
</p>
<h4><a name="convexhull">Convex hull</a><small>(new in Version 1.256)</small></h4>
<p>
<em>Actions -&gt; Convex hull</em> creates a convex IndexedFaceSet from
objects in a Scenegraph branch (it can also be used for a whole scenegraph,
but this often not very usefull). Only the Transform node data, mesh points, 
line points and PointSet node points are used to create a new IndexedFaceSet.
<br>
In the following example a sphere and a PointSet with 2 points is shown:<br>
<a href="convex_hull_before.wrl"><img src="convex_hull_before.png"></a><br>
Usage of <em>Actions -&gt; Convex hull</em> results in<br>
<img src="convex_hull_after.png"><br>
Adding 2 symetric NurbsSurfaces and 2 symetric NurbsCurves<br>
<img src="convex_hull_before2.png"><br>
Usage of <em>Actions -&gt; Convex hull</em> results in<br>
<img src="convex_hull_after2.png"><br>
Do not forget to fit IndexedFaceSet.creaseAngle:<br>
<img src="convex_hull_after3.png"><br>
</p>
<p>
Another application of convex hull is the connection of objects.<br>
To do this, a object has to be selected.<br>
<img src="convex1.png"><br>
Select with the right mouse button several vertices of the first object.<br>
<img src="convex2.png"><br>
After the release of the mouse button:<br>
<img src="convex3.png"><br>
Then use <em> Selection -&gt; Collect Vertices for convex hull</em>.<br>
Select Vertices of the second object.<br>
<img src="convex4.png"><br>
Then use <em> Selection -&gt; Collect Vertices for convex hull</em>.<br>
Then use <em> Actions -&gt; Convex hull</em>.<br>
<img src="convex5.png"><br>
A connection between the objects have been created.<br>
The scnengraph can be simplified e.g. with <a href="#boolean">
boolean modelling</a> (union).
</p>
<p>
Another type of connection is created with 
<em> Actions -&gt; Extrusion convex hull</em>. 
</p>
<h4><a name="meshreducer">Mesh reducer</a></h4>
<p>
If you work with <a href="#subdivide">Subdivide Modelling</a> (or
a 3D-Scanner), the number of resulting faces can explode.
As a little help, a mesh reducer exists.
As a example, the result of a convex hull operation is used:
<br>
<img src="meshreducer_before.png"><br>
Select a IndexedFaceSet, so <em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; Mesh reduce</em> 
becomes available.
<br>
<img src="meshreducer_dialog.png"><br>
If you click it, a dialog with the question about the percent of the
remaining faces occures.
When e.g. 5 percent is used, a 1/20 of the faces remain.
<br>
<img src="meshreducer_after.png"><br>
Take care that the Mesh reducer (like the convex hull tool) do not
deliver symetic resuls.
The only way out is symetric modelling.
</p>
<h4><a name="symetric">Symetric modelling</a></h4>
<p>
With <em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; make symetric</em> you can mirror the
one (plus) or orther (plus deselected) side of a IndexedFaceSet.
</p>
<h4><a name="skinbones">Skin and bones modelling</a></h4>
<p>
"Skin and bones" means that you have a surface as skin and joints/bones to
manipulate the surface. Skin and bones technics in X3D are connected
to the HAnimHumanoid node, cause the main application is human animation.<br>
But human animation require a lot of joints, so a flower with two
joints is shown.<br>
If you want to try a human (made with "makehuman") instead, use can use
<a href="human.x3d">human.x3d in the docs/usage_docs directory</a> instead.
<br>
A walk animation (extended with the "Nancy" animation of Cindy Ballreich)
is available as
<a href="human.x3dv">human.x3dv in the docs/usage_docs Directory</a>.
This animation was modified at the hips, to compensate the wide legged
pose of the "makehuman" output.
<br>
You can also choose the <a href="dune4kids_animal_en.html">4 legged animal 
tutorial</a>, to learn about skin and bones.
<br>
Back to the flower:
<br>
First we start with a IndexedFaceSet of a flower (created with a SuperRevolver,
converted to a modified Nurbs(Patch)Surface converted to IndexedFaceSet).
<br>
Of course, the procedure is also working with another IndexedFaceSet.<br>
<img src="flower1.png"><br>
Next we create a HAnimHumanoid node with <em>Create -&gt; X3D misc components
-&gt; H-Anim -&gt; HAnimHumanoid</em> and move the Shape node to
HAnimHumanoid.skin.
<br>
<img src="flower2.png"><br>
Do not worry, the flower disappears from the preview 3D-window.<br>
Now select the Coordinate node and use <em>Selection -&gt; Vertices</em>
 (or better: <em>Selection -&gt; HAnimJoint weight</em>).<br>
<img src="flower3.png"><br>
If <em>Actions -&gt;X symetric Modelling</em> is set, click to the
<img src="frog08.png"> icon.<br>
Use the right mouse button to pull a box around the half of the flower.
<br>
<img src="flower4.png"><br>
Use <em>Create -&gt; X3D misc components -&gt; H-Anim -&gt; HAnimJoint</em>.
<br>A dialog opens:
<br>
<img src="flower5.png"><br>
Click to OK.
<br>
<img src="flower6.png"><br>
A DEF dialog opens. Click to OK.
<br>
<img src="flower7.png"><br>
Select the HAnimHumanoid.skeleton field. Use <em>Edit -&gt; USE.</em>
<br>
<img src="flower8.png"><br>
Select "Scene".
<br>
<img src="flower8a.png"><br>
Select the Coordinate node and use the right mouse button to pull a 
box around the rest of the flower.
<br>
<img src="flower9.png"><br>
<br>
<br>A dialog opens:<br>
<img src="flower5.png"><br>
Click to OK.
<br>
A DEF dialog opens. Click to OK.
<br>
<img src="flower10.png"><br>
Select the HAnim_Humanoid.skeleton.HAnimJoint1.children field.
Use <em>Edit -&gt; USE.</em>
<br>
<img src="flower11.png"><br>
The flower and its joint is complete. Use <em>Mode -&gt; center</em>
to move the center of the joint. 
<br>
<img src="flower12.png"><br>
Use <em>Mode -&gt; rotate</em> then use the rotation handle to rotate the
upper part of the flower.
<br>
<img src="flower13.png"><br>
To set HAnimJoint.skinCoordWeight less than 1, select the matching 
HAnimJoint (select "Scene" to forget this selection), then select the 
Coordinate node.
<br>
<img src="flower14.png"><br>
Use the right mouse button to pull a box around the vertices you want to
set the weights.
<br>
<img src="flower15.png"><br>
Set the weight value in the dialog, the "node" and "parent" dialog element
has been set from the former HAnimJoint selection. Click OK.
<br>
<img src="flower16.png"><br>
The flower is ready, but HAnimHumanoid.skinCoord needs to be set.
<br>
<img src="flower17.png"><br>
You have to select HAnimHumanoid.skin.Shape.IndexedFaceSet.Coordinate and
use <em>edit -&gt; DEF</em>.
<br>
<img src="flower18.png"><br>
Click OK.<br>
Select HAnimHumanoid.skinCoord and use <em>edit -&gt; USE</em>.  
<br>
<img src="flower19.png"><br>
</p>
<h4><a name="boolean">Boolean modelling</a></h4>
<p>
White_dune allows the boolean modelling of IndexedFaceSets.<br>
To do this, a Group of 2 meshes (graphic object except Text (and other faces))
is subtracted, intersected or unioned.
A new IndexedFaceSet is created. Only closed objects are allowed, which
may not intersects self.<br>
<br>
It starts with a Box<br>
<img src="bool1.png"><br>
Next "Scene" has to be selected.<br>
<img src="bool2.png"><br>
Then a Sphere is added. It is not visible, but the handles are still
visible.<br>
<img src="bool3.png"><br>
The sphere is scaled up by dragging the handles.<br>
<img src="bool4.png"><br>
Next the first Transform has to be selected.<br>
<img src="bool5.png"><br>
Next <em>Actions -&gt; Rest of scenegraph branch -&gt;
move to -&gt; Group</em> is used. Of course there are simpler ways to
create a Group with 2 meshes.<br>
Next the Group has to be selected.<br>
<img src="bool6.png"><br>
Next <em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; Boolean operations -&gt; Intersection</em> 
is used.<br>
<img src="bool7.png"><br>
A IndexedFaceSet with the intersection has be created.<br>
Next "Scene" has to be selected.<br>
<img src="bool8.png"><br>
Next another sphere is added...<br>
<img src="bool9.png"><br>
... and scaled up<br>
<img src="bool10.png"><br>
Next the first Transform has to be selected.<br>
<img src="bool11.png"><br>
Next <em>Actions -&gt; Rest of scenegraph branch -&gt;
move to -&gt; Group</em> is used.<br>
Next the Group has to be selected.<br>
<img src="bool12.png"><br>
Next <em>(IndexedFace)Set -&gt; Boolean operations -&gt; Intersection</em> 
is used. A IndexedFaceSet is created.<br>
<img src="bool13.png"><br>
</p>
<h4><a name="modifier">Vertex Modifier</a><small>(new in Version 1.300)</small></h4>
<p>
The Vertex Modifier can be used to modify vertices.<br>
NurbsSurface or Coordinate has to be selected.<br>
A example starting with the SuperEllipsoid node:
<br><img src="modifier1.png"><br>
This node must be converted into a NurbsSurface with 
<em>Convert -&gt; Convert to Nurbs(Patch)Surface</em>
<br><img src="modifier2.png"><br>
A higher number of vertices has to be inserted, with less vertices the
vertex modifier ist useless.
<br><img src="modifier3.png"><br>
After that, the Nurbs(Patch)Surface node is selected.<br>
The Vertex Modifier icon (<img src="modifier4.png">) must be clicked.<br>
<a href="#nurbssymetric">X symetric Modelling</a> has to be enabled.
<br><img src="modifier5.png"><br>
After this "jump" has to be clicked, "radius" and "amount" should be 5
and the object has to be clicked at the position of the arrow.<br>
The exact orientation of the object is important here.
<br><img src="modifier6.png"><br>
A few vertices near the border of the object has been modified.<br>
Now click to normal.
<br><img src="modifier7.png"><br>
3 sliders are displayed, which show the direction of the modification.<br>
The default is (0, -1, 0), this is "down".
After that, nearly the same Position has to be clicked.<br>
<br><img src="modifier8.png"><br>
After that, you click "OK". The vertices are selected again and
the object can be handled as usual.
<br><img src="modifier9.png"><br>
</p>
<h4><a name="array">Array tool</a></h4>
<p>
White_dune allows to multiply objects. In difference to similar functions
in some 3D-Modellers (like the "Art of Illusion" program) it do not create
N copies of the same object. It creates N VRML Transform nodes (for 
translation, rotation etc. in respect to the Array dialog below.) 
with a VRML USE construct. A USE construct is a compact way to repeat
things in VRML. It is a sort of "pointer without difference" similar
to a hardlink to a UNIX file (if you know only M$Windows: a more smart way
of a shortcut to a file). A USEd node also changes, when it orginal 
changes.<br>
<br>
To use the Array tool, select the object you want to multiply
<br><br><img src=array_start.png><br><br>
and use <em>Actions -&gt; Array</em>. A dialog will occure
<br><br><img src=array_dialog.png><br><br>
where you can input the number of objects and the parameters for the 
transform node.
<br><br><img src=array_result.png><br><br>
When you change the orginal, all USEd nodes change too.
<br><br><img src=array_changed.png><br><br>
</p>
<h3>Repair commands in the "Actions" menue</a></h3>
<p>
The following commands are usefull, when you work with VRML/X3D files
made by other tools. The commands are made to correct some minor errors
and problems.
<ul>
 <li>
  <h4><a name="remove_invalid">Remove invalid children nodes</a></h4>
  <br>
  In some cases tools export files with invalid children nodes.<br>
  You have to differ between two cases when useing the remove command
  for invalid children nodes.
  <ul>
   <li>
    The programmer of the tools confused the meaning of DEF/USE with
    a macro usage like the usage of "#define" in the programming language
    C. Cause there is a additional matching USE command, the invalid
    children node can be removed inside white_dune without loosing 
    information in this case.
   </li>
   <li>
    The programmer of the tools made another mistake. In this case
    the remove of the invalid children node means a true data loss.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h4><a name="triangulate">Triangulate IndexedFaceSet</a></h4>
  <br>
  A IndexedFaceSet is a shape made of polygons. In general, this means
  there may be faces with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 etc. edges. Unfortunatly, the
  task to render general polygons in realtime 3D is not easy.<br>
  There may be three major problems if a face have more then 3 edges:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The polygon is self-intersecting. <br>
    There is a matching rule about a IndexedFaceSet in the VRML97 standard:<br>
    "Each face of the IndexedFaceSet shall have: ... vertices that define a
    non-self-intersecting polygon."<br>
    A self-intersecting polygons is usually seen as defect. Often it
    has been created by a true programming error with accidently 
    swaped edges of the polygon.<br>
    In any case, this polygons are not displayed as they are defined.<br>
    <img src="self_intersecting.png">
    <img src="triangulated_intersection.png"><br>
    Left a self-intersecting polygon, right the triangulated polygon
   </li>
   <li>
    The polygon is not flat. <br>
    There is a matching rule about a IndexedFaceSet in the VRML97 standard:<br>
    "Each face of the IndexedFaceSet shall have: ... vertices that define a 
    planar polygon."<br> 
    But unfortunatly, it is not very uncommon that this rule ignored, 
    despite there are at least two different ways to render 
    nonplanar polyons.<br>
    For example a polygon with edges 1, 2, 3, 4 can be rendered either
    as a triangle with edges 1, 2, 3 and a triangle with edges 3, 4, 1
    or rendered as a triangle with edges 4, 1, 2 and a triangle with edges 
    2, 3, 4. In the nonplanar case, this triangles look different.<br>
    <img src="nonflat1.png">
    <img src="nonflat2.png">
   </li>
   <li>
    The polygon not convex.<br>
    Unlike the two other cases, it is legal to have a IndexedFaceSet with 
    non-convex polygons, but its "convex" field must be set to "FALSE".
    In general, it is simpler/faster to render convex polygons than to render
    non-convex polygons. If the algorithm to render convex polygons is
    used to render non-convex polygons, the result may look very ugly.<br>
    <img src="nonconvex1.png">
    <img src="nonconvex2.png"><br>
    Left a non-convex polygon, rendered with "convex TRUE", 
    right the triangulated polygon.
   </li>
  </ul>
  All of this problems can be avoided by converting the polygons with more
  than 3 edges into triangles. This is called "triangulation".<br>
  In general, the triangulation of a polygon may require the creation
  of new vertices, so using triangulation for a IndexedFaceSet with 
  morphing animation is usually not a good idea.
 </li>
 <li>
  <h4><a name="set_path">Set path of all URLs to</a></h4>
  <br>
  Some tools, which write VRML/X3D Files produce paths in the "url" field
  (e.g. when using images/bitmaps for the ImageTexture node), which are
  only valid on the creating computer itself (e.g. "C:\temp\beispiel.png").
  But VRML/X3D files will be often transfered to a webserver.
  Even when the files has been transfered too to the webserver, it is
  not sure, that the paths in the VRML/X3D File is true.<br>
  The command "Set path of all URLs to" allows it, to change all paths
  at once. Very usefull is the defaultpath ".". This means that all
  image-, sound- and moviefiles are in the same directory as the the
  VRML/X3D file itself.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Other commands in the "Actions" menue</a></h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <h4><a name="object_url_edit">Edit object/URL</a></h4>
  <br>
  The usage of the "Edit Object"/"Edit URL" action has been already 
  described in the chapter about <a href="#simplescript">script editing</a>.
  Beside the usage of a Texteditor to change the "url" field of a Script
  node ("Edit URL") it also describe the usage of a special tool ("Edit object")
  to change the Script node by itself.<br>
  The same principles apply to some of the other nodes with "url" fields:
  the ImageTexture, the AudioClip and the MovieTexture node.<br>  
  The usage of <em>Action -&gt; object edit</em> starts depending from
  the selected node of type
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>ImageTexture</b> 
    a program to change imagefiles/bitmapfiles (.jpg/.png)
    (e.g. gimp or xpaint)
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>AudioClip</b> 
    a program to change soundfiles (.wav)
    (e.g. audacity or wavesurfer)
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>MovieTexture</b> 
    a program to change moviefiles (.mpeg)
    (e.g. avidemux)
   </li>
  </ul>
  The Linux/UNIX version of white_dune searches in the configuration step
  of the compilation for already known programs, that can be used for
  <em>Edit object</em>.<br>
  When there is no matching program available, a Dialog will ask at
  the first usage for a program.
  It is possible to exchange the programs via a dialog at
  <em>Options -&gt; Text/object Editor settings ...</em>.<br>
  A important hint for MacOSX users: the programm used to edit text or
  objects may not return a once to the commandline. This is often the case 
  for usual ".app" MacOSX programs. You can either try to use the
  binary program of a something.app MacOSX program in the directory
  something.app/Content/MacOS or you can prefer to use ported UNIX/X11 
  programs like gimp.
 </li>
 <li>
  <h4><a name="set_default">Set default values (keep scenegraph)</a></h4>
  <br>
  Sometimes it is usefull, to reset all changed values of a node
  back to the default values. But the nodes in the VRML/X3D scenegraph tree 
  often contain other nodes, so a reset to the default values would
  cause the deletion of hole subtrees.<br?
  Fields of node types (SFNode or MFNode) will be therefore left unchanged 
  when setting default values.
 </li>
 <li>
  <h4><a name="xray">xray rendering</a></h4>
  <br>
  Xray rendering is a experimental functions, which let you look through
  all solid surfaces of a scene. In general this can be very confusing, 
  but it is sometimes rather usefull.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4><a name="proto"><em>PROTO creation/editing</em></a></h4>
<p>
To create a PROTO, a scenegraph branch has to be created first. The nodes of 
the scenegraph branch are the major part of the PROTO.<br>
In this example, the nodes of a Shape/Box, Shape/Sphere and Viewpoint are
in the scenegraph branch.
<br><br><img src=proto_creation1.png><br><br>
To create a PROTO with this nodes you must click <em>Actions-&gt;Rest of 
scenegraph branch-&gt;Move to-&gt;new PROTO</em>.<br>
<br><br><img src=proto_creation2.png><br><br>
This is followed by a dialog, that asks for the name of be PROTO, here
you select "DOME".
<br><br><img src=proto_creation3.png><br><br>
As next follows a dialog, which let you select the arguments of the PROTO.
Later you select this Dialog by selecting the PROTO and use
<em>Edit -&gt; Object edit</em>.
As field argument you select SFColor color and press "Add".<br>
<br><br><img src=proto_creation4.png><br><br>
Then you press "ok" to end the Dialog.<br>
<br><br><img src=proto_creation5.png><br><br>
Next opens the RouteView/IS-Fenster, the PROTO "DOME" is selected.
<br><br><img src=proto_creation6.png><br><br>
It is now possible to add/change nodes of the PROTO with the rest of the
scenegraph. In this case, the Viewpoint node is moved out of the PROTO into
the scene.<br>
Next <em> Create -&gt; PROTO usage -&gt; DOME</em>
is used to display the DOME in the scenegraph.
<br><br><img src=proto_creation7.png><br><br>
Next you select a Material node in the PROTO and
use <em> Routes/IS -&gt Show node on top </em>.
<br><br><img src=proto_creation8.png><br><br>
Next you move Material node and PROTO in the Route/IS view to connect
color and diffuseColor zu.
<br><br><img src=proto_creation9.png><br><br>
Next you select the other Material node in the PROTO and
use <em> Routes/IS -&gt Show node on top </em>.
<br><br><img src=proto_creation10.png><br><br>
Next you move the other Material node and PROTO in the Route/IS view to connect
color and diffuseColor zu.

After that you can change "color" in the DOME node and insert another
Transform and DOME pair.

<h4><a name="vrmlcut"><em>VrmlCut scripted Proto</em></a></h4>
<p>
In VRML/X3D it is amaizingly different to build sequences of animations, 
usually called "movie". According to the realtime 3D nature of VRML/X3D
animations can be started interactivly and independendly from each, so
it there is difficult to define a overall timeline, just like the cutting
of a movie.<br>
One approach to ease this problem in white_dune is the usage of the 
scripted PROTO node VrmlCut. It has a Field "scenes", where single 
animation VRML/X3D data can be put into other scripted PROTO nodes named
VrmlScene. The content of such a VrmlScene node can be seen similar to
a single scene in a movie. The VrmlCut node switches from one VrmlScene to the 
next VrmlScene and try to jump to the first camera viewpoint and try to start
all the animations in the current VrmlScene node.<br>
Just like the SuperShape, SuperEllipsoid, etc. node the VrmlCut node is not a
buildin VRML node. It is a PROTO, a sequence of VRML nodes, that is composed
by a Switch node and a Script node and TimeSensor node.<br>
Like a Script node it has a changable set of fields/events. Cause multiple 
VrmlCut nodes would have multiple different sets of fields/events, you can 
have only one Proto definition of VrmlCut and therefore you can have only
one VrmlCut node per VRML-file.<br>
The VrmlCut switches between a sequence of VrmlScene nodes (basically a
Group-like node with some scripting for routing) driven by the internal
TimeSensor and the Script.<br>
All information between the VrmlCut, VrmlScene, TimeSensors (for animations)
and Viewpoints (cameras) are passed via ROUTE commands. This makes the
concept flexible (for example the ROUTE sources can be reused to drive other
nodes like Sound or Fog) but building much ROUTEs is much work.<br>
To reduce the work, the following method can be used:
<ul>
 <li>
  Build single scenes, each in one VRML file
 </li>
 <li>
  Open a VRML file with common background (or empty)
 </li>
 <li>
  Use <em>Create -&gt; Scripted PROTOs -&gt; VrmlCut</em> to create a VrmlCut node
 </li>
 <li>
  Directly use <em>Create -&gt; Scripted PROTOs -&gt; VrmlScene</em> to create a 
  VrmlScene node 
 </li>
 <li>
  Directly use <em>File -&gt; Import</em> to include a VRML file into the
  scene. All timesensors and the first viewpoint gets ROUTEs from the VrmlScene
  node. The loop field in the timersensors are switched off. The longest
  cycleTime of the timesensors are copied into the matching offset of the
  scenelengths field of the VrmlCut
 </li>
 <li>
  Directly use <em>Create -&gt; Scripted PROTOs -&gt; VrmlScene</em> to create
  the next VrmlScene node.
 </li>
 <li>
  Directly use <em>File -&gt; Import</em> to include the next VRML file.
 </li>
 <li>
  Continue with this steps 
 </li>
</ul>
At the end, you can use the "play" icon or <em>File-&gt;preview</em>to start the 
sequence of animations.<br>
With the sceneNumber, numberPreviousScenes and numberNextScenes fields of
VrmlCut can be used play a reduced range of scenes. This is usefull to optimize
the lengths of the scenes in the sceneLengths field of VrmlCut.

<h4><a name="xite"><em>Using X_ITE X3D browser</em></a></h4>
<p>
<a href="http://create3000.de/x_ite">X_ITE X3D</a> is a X3D browser
in the webbrowser, which (other than X3DOM) supports the X3D Script node.
<br> 
Modern webbrowser sandboxing problems make it impossible to use the
X_ITE X3D browser for previewing X3D files.<br>
Instead you have to use <em>File -&gt; Export as... -&gt; 
Export as X_ITE html/X3DV...</em> to write a .html and .x3dv file.
Then the .html file and the .x3dv file has to be uploaded to a webserver
to the same directory and the .html file can be loaded in the webbrowser. 
</p>
   <h4><a name="movie">Movie-Creation</a></h4>
<p>
To create a movie with white_dune, there is a script
run_dune_and_aqsis.sh or run_dune_povray.sh.<br>
In this scripts, white_dune creates .RIB files or a povray file.
This files will be converted with aqsis or povray (runnung on all processors)
into image-files, which will be converted with installed mencoder to a
.mp4 file (or with installed png2vuv and vpxenc to a .webm file).
</p>
<h4><a name="upload"><em>File -&gt; upload</em></a> </h4>
<p>
White_dune has a command (menuitem <em>File -&gt; Upload</em>) to upload a VRML 
file to a internet server.<br>
When you upload files to the internet, you are usually ask about a access
password. White_dune has the ability to store the password in a memory 
protected from swapspace by mlock/vlock calls.<br> 
The swapspace is a 
region on the disk where the content of the computer memory can be
swapped out to make space for other running programs. 
A intruder can inspect
the swapspace to search for passwords.<br>
Passing a password from one application (white_dune) to a other application 
(the upload command) in a secure way is not a easy task in respect to things
like swapspace.<br>
In the upload settings dialog (see <em>Options -&gt; Upload settings...</em>)
<br><br><img src=upload.png><br><br>
the upload command can have two parameters. Each parameter of the upload
commandline is set with the characters "%s". 
<ul>
<li>
In case of one "%s", this parameter
is replaced by the path of the VRML file, which is created from the 
the current white_dune data.<br>
If no password is used, the upload program can either ask for a 
password each upload or use a advanced authentication mechanism like
ssh passphrase.
</li>
<li>
If there is one "%s" and there is a password, this password is sended
via standardin to the upload program. Usually the content of
standartin/standardout is not protected from spacespace, so there
is possibly a security risk when using this option.
</li>
<li>
Using two "%s" send the password via a commandline option. On most 
Operationsystems, this is a high security risk, cause commandline 
options can be read by any other user on the same system.
</li>
</ul>
The last line in the upload settings dialog gives you the ability 
to reload a HTML-webpage after the upload. To use it, you have to
type in the HTML tags that will be copied into a HTML file.<br>
For example, the following dialog will copy the data by 
white_dune to a VRML file with a static name and will display this
VRML file together with the string "hello" in the webbrowser on the next 
<em>File -&gt; upload</em> command. 
<br><br><img src=upload_copy.png><br><br>
The HTML tags line can contain "%s" characters, which would be replaced
by the password. This would result in a HTML file with the password in it. 
This is a very high security risk, do not use
this feature without knowing exactly what you are doing !
