 <title>Create a simple OpenGL/C++ game with white_dune</title> 
</head> 
<body>
<h2>Create a simple OpenGL/C++ game with white_dune</h2> 
<p> 
You can create OpenGL-programs written in C++ with white_dune.<br>
Here a simple example is shown, the needs only a few lines of
programming code.<br>
In the first step a prototype with X3D/javascript is created, that
is extended with C++ later.
</p>
<h3>javascript/X3D prototype</h3>
As base, the in X3D available white_dune logo is used.
It is a 3d model of a pinguin in a landscape of dunes and a pyramid.<br>
<img src=game1.png>
<br>
For programming, it makes no difference, is the pinguin is replaced with
a box and the landscape is replaced with a large thin box...<br>
In the first step, the target (pinguin or box) is animated with a 
CurveAnimation.<br>
<img src=game2.png>
<br>
Next, a Text-node with "Game over" is created.
<br>
<img src=game3.png>
<br>
Next a Switch-node is created and the target is moved into it.<br>
To make the target visible, Switch.whichChoice must be set to 0.<br>
Next another Switch-node is created and the text is moved into it.<br>
<img src=game4.png>
<br>
Next a Script-node is created.<br>
Next <em>Routes/IS -&gt; rebuild</em> is used. 
A new window is shown, that shows the CurveAnimation.
<img src=game5.png>
<br>
Next, the Script-node is selected (clicked).<br>
A SFVec3f-input-function "transform_in" is created.<br>
<img src=game6.png>
<br>
In the same way. a SFVec3f-input-function "proximity_in" is created.<br>
<img src=game8.png>
<br>
Next a SFInt32-output-variable "out_text" is created.<br>
<img src=game9.png>
<br>
Next a SFInt32-output-variable "out_tux" is created.<br>
<img src=game10.png>
<br>
Now a Proximity-Sensor-node is created and 
<em>Routes/IS -&gt; show node on top</em> is used.<br>
Now the script-node is selected and 
<em>Routes/IS -&gt; show node on top</em> is used.<br>
The node are moved and you connect
ProxomitySensor.position_changed and Script.proximity_in
<img src=game11.png>
<br>
Next, you connect CurveAnimation1.position_changed and Script.translation_in
<br>
<img src=game12.png>
<br>
Next, you connect Script.out_text and Switch.set_whichChoice of the text 
Switch.<br>
<img src=game14.png>
<br>
Next, you connect Script.out_tux and Switch.set_whichChoice of the target
Switch.<br>
<br>
<img src=game15.png>
<br>
Now the script-node is selected and a SFVec3f-data-variable transfrom_data 
is created. 
<br>
<img src=game16.png>
<br>
Next a SFBool-data-variable game_over is created.
<br>
<img src=game17.png>
<br>
The script node is selected and <em>Edit -&gt; URL edit</em> is used
.<br>
The following javascript programm has to be inserted:<br>
<pre>
"ecmascript:

        function transform_in(value)
        {
           transform_data = value;
        }

        function proximity_in(value)
        {
           if (!(game_over) &&
               (Math.abs(transform_data.x - value.x) < 2) &&
               (Math.abs(transform_data.y - value.y) < 3) &&
               (Math.abs(transform_data.z - value.z) < 2)) {
               game_over = true;
               out_text = 0; // show Text
               out_tux = -1; // hide TUX
               }
        }
"
</pre>
<br>
To make the X3D-Game available, the X3D-Browser "FreeWRL" must be installed
and <em>Options -&gt; preview settings</em> must be configured 
for <em>File -&gt; Previe</em>.
<br>
<img src=game19.png>
<br>
Now <em>File -&gt; Preview</em> has to be used and via the FreeWRL navigation 
the target is reached, so the "show Text/hide TUX" code is executed.<br>
Screenshots of the game:<br>
Before the reach of the target:
<br>
<img src=game20.png>
<br>
After the reach of the target:
<br>
<img src=game21.png>
<br>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Extension with C++</h3> 
<p>
Now the Script node is selected and <em>Edit -&gt; URL edit</em> is used.<br>
The programm is extended with a C++ part:<br>
<br>
<pre>
"ecmascript:

        function transform_in(value)
        {
           transform_data = value;
        }

        function proximity_in(value)
        {
           if (!(game_over) &&
               (Math.abs(transform_data.x - value.x) < 2) &&
               (Math.abs(transform_data.y - value.y) < 3) &&
               (Math.abs(transform_data.z - value.z) < 2)) {
               game_over = true;
               out_text = 0; // show Text
               out_tux = -1; // hide TUX 
               }
        }
"
"c++:

   X3dScript_Script1 *self = (X3dScript_Script1 *)node;
   self->transform_data[0] = self->transform_in[0];
   self->transform_data[1] = self->transform_in[1];
   self->transform_data[2] = self->transform_in[2];
   if (!(self->game_over) &&
       (fabsf(self->transform_data[0] - self->proximity_in[0]) < 2) &&
       (fabsf(self->transform_data[1] - self->proximity_in[1]) < 3) &&
       (fabsf(self->transform_data[2] - self->proximity_in[2]) < 2)) {
       self->game_over = true;
       self->out_text = 0; // show Text
       self->out_tux = -1; // hide TUX
   }
"
</pre>
Now the C++-Export-Verzeichnis of white_dune need to be copied to the
HOME-Verzeichnis:
<br>
<pre>
$ cp -r wdune-*/docs/export_example_c++/opengl_example/ $HOME
</pre>
<br>
The created X3D-Datei must be stored to $HOME/opengl_example/robot.x3dv
<br>
Change to the directory
<br>
<pre>
$ cd $HOME/opengl_example/ 
</pre>
<br>
And use
<br>
<pre>
$ make && ./render
</pre>
<br>
to compile and execute the programm.
