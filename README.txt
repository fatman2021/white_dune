History of dune/white_dune
==========================

"white_dune" continue the work of Stephen F. White on the program "dune".

As today (Thu May 31 15:55:58 CEST 2001), the sourcecode of dune 0.13 
(http://dune.sourceforge.net/download.html) has not been updated since 
more than a year, despite some useful patches and bugfixes with possible 
solutions has been publiced. 
In this situation we decided to continue the work as white_dune, giving
Stephen F. White the possibilty to continue his work at sourceforge.

white_dune is:
- a graphical editor to load/create/store X3D/VRML97 files
- a simple NURBS/Superformula/Subdivide based 3D modeller
- a 3D animation tool
- a commandline X3D/VRML97 compiler
- a program with (currently) 3 different GUIs
- a program for beginners/children to create their first 3D animation ("-4kids")
- a tool (and examples) that supports you in learning X3D or VRML97
- a tool to load static/animated X3D/VRML97 files (directly or via "Inline"
  commands) created by programs like maya, 3D Studio MAX, Cinema4D, blender, 
  wings3d, art of illusion etc. and add interaction/scripting 
- a tool to manipulate 3D data with 3D input devices (e.g. joystick/spaceball)
- a tool to view 3D data with quadbuffer stereoview (e.g. shutterglases)
- a potential simple to use frontend for your gameengine/scenegraph library
- a open framework to create or process 3D data and store it as a ISO standard 
- a open source project

WHAT IS THIS THING?
-------------------

Dune is a simple tool for the creation of VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling
Language).  Dune is a weekend project that went horribly, horribly wrong.
Dune is delicious and nutritious.  Dune is fun for the whole family.

For instuctions how to build white_dune, refer to the INSTALL.txt document.

White_dune is a low level X3D/VRML97 tool for Unix/Linux and M$Windows. It
can read X3D/VRML97 files, display and let the user change the 
scenegraph/fields.
Unlike most highlevel 3D authoring tools, white_dune uses a lightning model 
based on the X3DV/VRML97 standard. 

Despite dune/white_dune is not complete yet (especially X3D 3.3 in the 3D 
window), it let you already use more X3D/VRML97 features then most other 
graphical VRML97/X3D producing tools.

White_dune do not support the VRML1/Inventor fileformats.
White_dune support XML encoded X3D files if it has been
compiled/linked against the expat library.

Since version 0.25beta white_dune has documentation how to work with
VRML amendment 1 or X3D NURBS modelling. It is possible to create complicated 
(including IndexedFaceSet shapes with spikes and edges) shape objects 
with NURBS modelling.

white_dune has features (e.g. "export as pure VRML97"), to use 
VRML amendment 1 NURBS nodes together with a VRML97/X3D browser which do not 
support the VRML amendment 1 standard yet.

Similarly white_dune support the most important nodes of the X3D NURBS
component. 

The mesh modelling features of white_dune can not compare 
to general purpose 3D modellers with VRML97 export like maya, 
3D Studio MAX, Cinema 4D, blender, wings3D, etc. but (unlike white_dune) 
most of this programs support only a small part of the X3D/VRML97 features.
You can use white_dune to advance the output of such mesh modeller (e.g.
add interaction or scripting) or use white_dune as a intergration tool via
the VRML/X3D "Inline" command (to avoid a broken toolchain).

Examples for open source 3D modellers with mesh VRML97 export are 
wings3D or Art of Illusion. 
Blender support the export of XML encoded X3D files.

Since version 0.27beta white_dune has support for 3D-modelling based
on the so called "superformula":

        pow(pow(fabs(cos(m * angle / 4.0) / a), n2) + 
            pow(fabs(cos(m * angle / 4.0) / b), n3), -1.0 / n1)

This formula has been found by a horticultural engeneer in 1997 and 
can be used to form n-symetric shapes similar to shapes in nature like flowers,
leafs or starfishs.
Superformula based shapes are not part of VRML97 by itself and are 
implemented by a PROTO (self defined VRML97 node) with scripting 
("scripted node"). Superformula based shapes can be converted either to a 
Extrusion node or to a IndexedFaceSet node. IndexedFaceSet based scripted 
nodes can be approximated to a NurbsSurface node as a starting point for
further NURBS-modelling.
White_dune also has a PROTO for the superellipsoid, a special case of a 
superformula shape. It can be used to form a sphere, a box, a cylinder, 
a octaeder and (most important) rounded forms of this shapes with only 
2 parameters.

Since 0.29beta, white_dune supports both english, german and italian menus 
and messages in one binary.
Information how to translate white_dune to foreign languages can be found under
docs/developer_docs/dune_developer.html#localisation
Translation of the menus neither require a special tool nor programmer knowhow,
it can be done with a simple text editor by replacing anything between the 
"" signs in src/dune.english.rc

Minimal system requirements: 
white_dune-0.30pl8 has been sucessfully compiled and run sucessfully on a 
PC with Intel 80486 DX2/50, 18MB RAM (according to free(1)), 640x480 screen 
resolution and a 8-Bit graphicscard (256 colors) running Linux 1.2.
With this system, you can animate a simple box (8 polygons) a bit faster than 
1 frame per second. It can take a few seconds, till you get reaction to a 
mouse drag in the 3D window. 
Even simple actions can cause white_dune to run into swapspace. 
You need 72MB swapspace and a day to compile white_dune on this system.
Note: Modern mesa3d/OpenGL implementations usually do not work anymore with 
a 8-Bit graphicscard. 

white_dune has support for stereoscopic "toe in" view via "quadbuffer" 
capable stereo visuals ("stereo in a window"), not splitscreen stereo.

Quadbuffer capable stereo visuals are usually used with shutterglases, 
but beamers that allow the use of shutterglases are often very expensive.
Instead of shutterglases, you can also use either a "XPO" box (stereo splitter)
or a graphicscard (e.g. Nvidia Quadro) with "stereo cloneview" features
to drive a onewall based on 2 beamers with polarised light filters and 
polarised light glases.

This has been successfully tested with the following configurations:

(*) use a "preemptive" Linux kernel (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y in /usr/src/linux/.config)

If you start dune in the commandline with the -stereo option in the 
commandline, you can also use stereoview under M$Windows (again: only
when quadbuffer is supported)

(**) needs the usage of extra software to support quadbuffer (see below)

Please tell us, if you tested white_dune with stereoscopic view 
successfully on other systems.

To enable "quadbuffer" capable stereo visuals on different systems, you
can use (as root):

 - Linux/XIG DX-Platinum  

   $ Xsetup 

   to enable stereo in the grapics card menu. 

   Then start/restart the Xserver.


 - Linux/Nvidia Quadro/XFree86 (only for Quadro class Nvidia graphic cards)

   install Nvidias kerneldriver and XFree module
   edit the XF86Config file and add (depending on you stereo display) 
   a line like

   Option "Stereo" "1" 
   Option "Stereo" "2" 
   Option "Stereo" "3"
   ... 
   Option "Stereo" "10" 

   to the Section "Device".

   Then start/restart the Xserver.


 - SUN Solaris   
   
   Type at the commandline:

   $ fbconfig -res stereo

   Then start/restart the Xserver.


 - SGI IRIX
   
   Type something like 

   $ /usr/gfx/setmon -n 1024x768_96s

   at the commandline.
   
   On SGI Indigo2 Impact machines you need to start/restart the Xserver.
   On more modern IRIX machines you can change this on the fly without root
   permissions.

 - AIX 

   As Far as we know, nothing especially to do. You can change the 
   resolution and screen frequency with "smit" in 
  
   System Managment -> Devices -> Graphic Devices -> Select the Display Size

 - Intel PC/Windows 2000/Nvidia Geforce

   The driver of some graphiccards with Nvidia Geforce GPU (e.g. ASUS Deluxe, 
   this are the graphiccards with the connector to the ASUS VR-100 
   shutterglasses) can be patched to support Nvidia Quadro features,
   especially a quadbuffer stereovisual.
   After the installation of some software, you have use it to set the 
   Device ID of the Nvidia Geforce graphicscard to the Device ID of a 
   Nvidia Quadro card and reinstall the driver from Nvidia.
   See http://www.stereovision.net/articles/nvidiaopengl/nvstereoogl.htm
   for more information.
   You need to start dune with the commandlineoption "-stereo"

There is also experimental support for anaglyph glasses (red/green and 
red/blue) via the OpenGL accumlation buffer (see -anaglyph option). 

Currently, white_dune is on its way to become a immersive vrml97 editor
with the possibilty to use 3D inputdevices. 
The usage of 3D inputdevices is extremly usefull for animation creation.

This has been successfully tested with the following configurations:

The 3Dconnexion SpacePilot only works on M$Windows XP and higher. Cause
the standard white_dune binary is not limited to M$Windows XP and higher,
you need to compile white_dune for 3Dconnexion SpacePilot support by 
yourself and need to add
#define HAVE_WINDOWS_SPACEBALL 1
to config.h before compiling.

For more details how to use 3D inputdevices see the manpage and the
examples in docs/commandline_examples.
Please tell us, if you tested white_dune with a 3D input device successfully 
on other systems and send us the used commandline.

We also tested 2D joysticks under Linux and M$Windows sucessfully.

Read the file INSTALL, if you want to install white_dune on a Unix system

==========================================================================

Changed in white_dune Version 0.16:

 Initial png support from OpenVRML (OpenVRML is LGPL), don't trust your eyes 8-)

 SGI type ALT-mouse navigation, beware of your windowmanager 8-)

 You see better, what you type when changing fields

 dune do not eat up PROTO Definitions any longer

 dune do not eat up EXTERNPROTO Definitions any longer, 
     but default values of Fieldvalues are not read

 dune tries now to save it's contence to $HOME/.dune_crash_*_*.wrl, when
      older versions of dune would crash in some situations.

 two simple how to use exercises included, see docs/index.html

===========================================

Changed in white_dune Version 0.17:

 Normal Node in IndexedFacesets is displayed more correctly - still no 
  support for NormalsPerVertex 8-(

 Problematic line in resource.c fixed.
 
 Errors in configure.in (not present in version 0.15) hopefully fixed 8-(

 Write to files now checks for errors 

 Signalhandling should be now a bit more robust 

 some coredump on programexit fixed

 Minor changes in look of program

 Very invisible "better than nothing" Shape->Text Rending for Unix included 8-(

 Port back to Windows NT:
                          to compile, you may want to copy config.h.nt
                          to config.h, execute usebison.bat and useflex.bat
                          and use dune.dsw
===========================================

Changed in white_dune Version 0.18:

 Bug in saveing files corrected

 initial support to read and write X3D files via the nist.gov 
 X3D translators. 
 Use at your own risk !
 To avoid dataloss, the temporary .wrl files are kept in the directories 
 x3dv2/test and /tmp

 Warning: Currently the translators fail to produce valid VRML97 code for some
 rare used nodes like VisibilitySensor or Collision.
 Currently dune need valid code to work.
 see README.x3dtranslators

 writing of MFInt32 data are written in one line till -1 (if any)

 avoid too near numbers in channelview at width 1280 

 optional use saxon (faster) instead of the x3dv2 nist.gov X3D translator
